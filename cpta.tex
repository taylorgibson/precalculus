\section[{Recursive Functions}]{Recursive Functions}\label{chapter04-section01}
In a previous chapter we learned that a function is a special sets of ordered pairs.  In most of the examples in the preceeding chapters, functions were described by an algebraic expression that could be evaluated for a particular input value resulting in a unique output value. Such algebraic expressions are called closed form or explicit expressions.  For these functions, the relationship \(y=f(x)\) is used to show how the \(y\)-value is related to the given \(x\)-value. For example, the function \(f(x)=x^2+6x\) is an explicit function. This notation tells us that any particular numerical value for \(x\) is paired with the \(y\)-value equal to \(x^2+6x\). So 1 is paired with 7, since \(f(1)=(1)^2+6(1)=7\) , and \(-3\) is paired with \(-9\), since \(f(-3)=(-3)^2+6(-3)=-9\).%
\par
In this section we will investigate functions that are defined recursively. The domain values for these functions are positive whole numbers, and each range value is defined in terms of the preceding range value, rather than in terms of an \(x\)-value.%
\begin{example}[Ibuprofen in the blood stream]\label{ibuprofen-example-one-dose}
Joan has a headache and decides to take a 200mg ibuprofen tablet for pain relief.  The drug is absorbed into her system and stays in her system until the drug is metabolized and filtered out by the liver and kidneys.  Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized.  Every four hours, Joan's body removes \(67\%\) of the ibuprofen that was in her body at the beginning of that four-hour time period.  How much of the ibuprofen will remain in her system \(24\) hours after taking the \(200\)mg tablet?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad One way to generate values for the amount of ibuprofen in Joan's system is to use an iterative process.  In any iterative process the current value of a variable is used to determine the next value.  In this example, we generate a new amount of ibuprofen by subtracting the amount of ibuprofen filtered out of Joan's system from the amount that was previously there.  Since Joan begins with 200mg of ibuprofen, we write%
\begin{gather*}
D_0=0
\end{gather*}
where \(D_0\) is used to represent the amount of ibuprofen present at the start of the process%
\par
We will use \(D_1\) to represent the amount of ibuprofen left after four hours.  The subscripts are used to count the steps, or iterations,  in the iterative process. In this problem the subscript  represents the number of four-hour time periods since Joan took the tablet.  In four hours, her kidneys have filtered out \(67\%\) of the drug from her bloodstream, so we write%
\begin{gather*}
D_1=D_0-.67D_0=200-.67\cdot 200=66
\end{gather*}
%
\par
The amount of drug in her body after a second four-hour time period is represented by \(D_2\).%
\begin{gather*}
D_2=D_1-0.67D_1=66-.067\cdot 66=21.78
\end{gather*}
%
\par
Similarly, we know that successive values of the amount of drug in her body can be generated by%
\begin{gather*}
D_3=D_2-0.67D_2=7.187\\
D_4=D_3-0.67D_3=2.372
\end{gather*}
and, in general,%
\begin{gather*}
D_n=D_{n-1}-0.67D_{n-1},n=1,2,3...
\end{gather*}
%
\par
Using a spreadsheet or calculator, we can generate successive values of \(D_n\) as shown in \hyperref[figure-plot-ibuprofen-one-dose]{Figure~3}.  Note that values in the table are rounded to three decimal places but that exact values were used in all computations. The amount of drug in Joan's body drops to less than \(1\) mg between the fourth and fifth time periods.  If she takes a single \(200\) mg dose, Joan will have only about \(0.258\) mg remaining in her body \(24\) hours later.%

\begin{example}[Repated dose of ibuprofen]\label{example-2}
Joan strained her knee playing tennis and her doctor has prescribed ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and control pain.  Joan is instructed to take two 200-milligram ibuprofen tablets every 4 hours for three days.  Joan doesn’t like taking medicine, so she decides to take only one tablet every four hours for six days.  After the six days, Joan’s knee has not responded to the medication.  Naturally, she knew that the knee would take longer to respond to the reduced treatment, but she did not expect no response at all.  What could have happened?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In this situation, Joan did not take just a single 200 mg tablet.  Every four hours she took another 200 mg tablet, and we can modify our recursive system to model this behavior. At the end of the nth four-hour period, Joan’s body has filtered \(67\%\) of the drug that was in her body after n-1st  four-hour period.  In addition, 200 mg from the new tablet have been added into her body.  The recursive system representing the amount of ibuprofen in Joan’s body if she takes one tablet every four hours is%
%
\begin{gather*}
D_0=200\\
D_n=D_{n-1} - 0.67D_{n-1} + 200, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
The subscript n represents the number of four-hour time periods that have elapsed since Joan took the first dose.  By iterating the recursive system we can generate values of \(D_n\) that represent the amounts of drug in Joan’s body at the end of each four-hour period, assuming  \(67\%\) of the drug is filtered in a four-hour period.  These values, rounded to two decimal places, are shown together with a graph in \hyperref[figure-plot-ibuprofen-multi-dose]{Figure~6}%

\par
The points shown in \hyperref[figure-plot-ibuprofen-multi-dose]{Figure~6} represent the amount of the drug in Joan’s body immediately after she takes a tablet.  Between consecutrive doses, we know that the level of the drug declines.  We assume that the level “jumps up” at the moment she takes another tablet, and the recursive system enables us to compute these values.   If we  record the drug levels only after she takes a tablet, then we see that these values reach an equilibrium of approximately 298.51 mg.  To see why this equilibrium has been reached, consider how much of the 298.51 mg of the drug will be filtered in four hours.  Joan’s kidneys will filter out \(67\%\) of the 298.51 mg in her body, or approximately 200 mg, which will be replaced when she takes the next tablet. Equilibrium occurs because the amount of drug taken into the body is the same as the amount filtered prior to taking the next tablet.%
\par
Suppose the drug Joan is taking has a therapeutic level of 450 mg.  This means that there must be at least 450 milligrams of the drug in her body for Joan to receive the benefits of the drug.  No wonder she thought the drug was not working.  It wasn’t!%

\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Using Recursion to Understand Loans and Investments}]{Using Recursion to Understand Loans and Investments}\label{chapter04-section02}
Recursive systems are useful for finding solutions to various types of problems.%
\par
Suppose you are interested in purchasing a car and need a \(\$10,000\) loan. The lending agency is going to charge you interest each month and you are going to make a payment each month. You plan to pay \(\$230\) each month until the loan is paid off. Suppose the interest rate is \(0.45\%\) per month (approximately \(5.4\%\) per year). How long will it take you to repay the loan? What is the total amount you will have to repay?  You can answer these questions using recursion.%
\par
When making monthly payments to repay a loan, an interest payment is charged on all of the money that is owed at the end of each month.  In this example, at the end of the first month you will owe \((0.0045)(10,000)=\$45.00\) in interest. After making the first payment you will owe \(\$10,000+\$45-\$230=\$9815\). The amount you still owe on the loan at the end of a month is equal to the amount you owed previously plus the interest minus the amount of your payment. This is expressed in a recursive system as:%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=10,000, L_{n-1}+(0.0045)\cdot L_{n-1}-230, where n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
where \(L_n\) is the amount you owe on the loan after \(n\) months.  This amount is also known as the \emph{principal}, or the \emph{outstanding balance}. If we iterate this system, the values we generate represent the outstanding balance at the end of each month.%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_1=L_0+(0.0045)\cdot L_0-230=10,000+(0.0045)\cdot 10,000-230=9,815\\
L_2=L_1+(0.0045)\cdot L_1-230=9,815+(0.0045)\cdot 9,815-230=9,629.17\\
L_3=L_2+(0.0045)\cdot L_2-230=9,629.17+(0.0045)\cdot 9,629.17-230=9,442.50
\end{gather*}
Note that values have been rounded to the nearest cent.  All the decimal places on the calculator were retained in the computations.%
\par
After three months, you will owe \(\$9,442.50\) on the loan. Notice that you have paid a total of \(\$230\cdot 3=\$690\), but only \(\$10,000-\$9442.50=\$557.50\) was applied towards decreasing the principal of the loan. The remaining \(\$132.50\) was payment of interest.%
\par
We can continue generating values of \(L_n\) using a more compact form of the iterative equation,%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_n=(1.0045)\cdot L_{n-1}-230
\end{gather*}
which yields%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_4=(1.0045)\cdot L_3-230=\$9,254.99\\
L_5=(1.0045)\cdot L_4-230=\$9,066.64\\
L_6=(1.0045)\cdot L_5-230=\$8,877.44
\end{gather*}
After six months, you owe \(\$8,877.44\) of the original \(\$10,000\) principal.  You have paid \(\$1,380\) in interest, and this payment has reduced the outstanding balance by \(\$1,122.56\).  Over \(\$250\) was interest on the loan.%
\par
If we continue the payments of \(\$230\) for four years (48 months), the final payment will probably not bring the outstanding balance to exactly zero dollars.  Although it is possible to calculate a loan payment that will exactly pay off the loan in 48 equal payments, it is common practice for the lender to make all of the payments, except for the last one, a whole dollar amount, or even round these payments to the nearest five or ten-dollar amounts. Doing this will almost certainly make the final payment different from the rest.  This final payment is known as the balloon payment%
\par
The graph and partial table in Figure XX show that it will take \(47\) payments to get the balance down to \(\$341.20\).  After one additional month the balance will be \(\$341.20\cdot 1.0045=\$342.74\) if we round in the usual manner.  Thus, the balloon payment would be \(\$342.74\).%

Since the first \(47\) payments were each \(\$230\), the total amount paid is \(47\cdot \$230 + \$342.74 = \$11,152.74\).  We see that it costs \(\$1,152.74\) to borrow \(\$10,000\) for \(48\) months.%
\par
The process of paying off a loan is known as \emph{amortizing the loan}, or \emph{loan amortization}. When we study loan amortization, we are interested in the amount borrowed, the interest rate, the payment, the length of time it will take to repay the loan and the total amount the borrower will have to repay.%
\par
We can generalize the recursive system used to determine the total amount repaid as follows.  If we borrow an amount \(A\) and let \(r\) represent the interest rate per time period and \(P\) the amount of the payment during each time period, we can describe the amount owed after \(n\) time periods with the system%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=A, L_n=L_{n-1} + r \cdot L_{n-1} - P , n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
or%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=A,L_n=(1+r)L_{n-1} - P , n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
You should complete practice problem 1 at the end of the section at this time%
\par
When borrowers take out a loan, they typically know the amount they want to borrow, the interest rate they will have to pay, and the length of time they have to pay off the loan.  We are interested in determining the payment that will allow the borrower to pay back the loan in the required time.  For most loans, the borrower makes payments every month. Thus, a car loan that needs to be repaid in \(5\) years requires \(60\) monthly payments and a mortgage loan that is repaid in \(15\) years requires \(180\) monthly payments. For simplicity's sake, our first few examples will assume that payments are made annually (that is, once per year) rather than monthly.%
\begin{example}[Finding the Yearly Payment Needed to Pay Off a Loan]\label{example-3}
Suppose you buy a car and take out a loan of \(\$22,000\) at \(6.5\%\) annual interest to be paid back over four years.  What is the yearly payment you must make to pay off the loan in four equal payments?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Referring to equation XX we have%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=22,000,L_n=(1+0.065)L_{n-1}-P
\end{gather*}
and our goal is to find the value of \(P\) so that \(L_4=0\)%
\par
If there were no interest charged, you would have to make a payment of \(\$5,500\) each year to repay the \(\$22,000\).  Since you must pay interest on the loan, \(\$5,500\) per year is obviously too small a payment and we conclude that \(\> \$5,500\).  We can confirm that \(\$5,500\) is too small a payment  with the recursive system:%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=22,000,L_n=(1+0.065)L_{n-1} - 5,500
\end{gather*}
\begin{table}

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-1}}
\end{table}
This confirms that if we make an annual payment of \(\$5,500\) for each of 4 years, the outstanding balance on a loan of \(\$22,000\) is \(\$4,062.80\) at the end of the \(4\) years. So \(\$5,500\) is too small an annual payment to pay off the loan.%
\par
With a \(6.5\%\) annual interest rate, we know that the interest for the first year is \(\$1,430\) ( \(6.5\%\) of \(\$22,000\) ), so a reasonable guess for the payment might be \(\$5500+\$1430=\$6930\). However, in the second year we will need to pay less than \(\$1430\) in interest because the outstanding balance has decreased.  Therefore, a payment of \(\$6930\) per year will result in an overpayment for the last three years.  The calculations below show that \(\$6930\) is indeed too large an annual payment; that is, \(P \lt 6,930\).%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=22,000, L_n=(1+0.065)L_{n-1}-6,930

\end{table}
We have established that \(\$5500\) is too small a payment and \(\$6930\) is too large a payment; that is, \(5,500 \lt P \lt 6,930\)  Our next logical guess for a payment might be mid-way between these two payments, or \(\$6215\).  We can do recursive calculations to see if this payment is too small, which would result in a positive outstanding balance after \(4\) years, or if this payment is too large, resulting in a negative outstanding balance after \(4\) years.%

An annual payment of \(\$6,215\) is not sufficient to pay off the loan in four years, as a balance of \(\$911.67\) remains after the four payments.  We conclude that \(6,215 \lt P \lt 6,930\) and we need to pay more than \(\$6,215\).  If we again select the average of two payments, one that is too large and one that is too small, we will have arrived at a better guess.  We know \(\$6,930\) is too large and \(\$,6215\) is too small, so our next guess will be \(\frac{6930+6215}{2} = \$6,572.50\).  The successive balances would now be as shown.%

\caption{\label{table-4}}
\end{table}
We see that a payment of \(\$6,572.50\) is too large since after \(4\) payments you have paid \(\$663.90\) more than necessary. We now know that the appropriate payment \(P\) is in the interval  \(6,215 \lt  P \lt 6,572.50\)%
\par
We can continue the process of averaging two payments, one that is too large and one that is too small. Eventually we find that three payments of \(\$6,393.75\) and a fourth balloon payment of \(\$6,393.75 + \$123.89\) will bring the outstanding balance to zero dollars.%
\end{example}
The process used to find an appropriate payment is called \emph{binary search}. We began the process by finding an interval that contained the appropriate payment. This interval is bounded by a payment that is too low and a payment that is too high. We found the midpoint of the interval and determined if that payment was too large or too small.  If the "midpoint payment" is too high, that is, if we have a negative balance after four payments, then consider a new interval that is the lower half of the previous interval; otherwise, take the new interval to be the upper half of the previous interval We continue bisecting, which results in a smaller and smaller interval that we know contains the appropriate payment.  We stop bisecting the interval as soon as we have found a payment that results in a balance of zero, or as close to zero as we need.%

\typeout{Section 4.3 Geometric Growth and Decay}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Geometric Growth and Decay}]{Geometric Growth and Decay}\label{chapter04-section03}
Some recursively defined functions have important applications in life.  One of the simplest, yet most important, represents \emph{geometric decay}. In geometric decay, the value of the function at time \(n\) is directly proportional to the value at time. This relationship suggests a recursive definition for geometric decay. The first example from Section \hyperref[chapter04-section01]{1}, Example \hyperref[ibuprofen-example-one-dose]{1}, involved the amount of ibuprofen in Joan's system at time \(n\) if she takes a single \(200\) mg tablet. Since her body filters out \(67\%\) of the ibuprofen present, the amount remaining after \(n\) time intervals is always \(33\%\) of the amount remaining after \(n-1\) time intervals.%
\par
In that case, we calculated the amount of drug in Joan's boady with the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
D_0=200, D_n=0.33 \cdot D_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
\begin{example}[Fading Blue Jeans]\label{example-fading-blue-jeans}
Blue jeans fade when they are washed. Suppose a pair of jeans loses \(2\%\) of its color with each washing.  How much of the original color is left after \(50\) washes?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad In this problem, we use the system%
%
\begin{gather*}
C_0=1, C_n=0.98 \cdot C_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
where \(C_n\) is the amount of color remaining in the jeans after \(n\) washings%
\par
We use \(1\) as the initial value to represent all or \(100\%\) of the color.  Since we want to measure the amount of color remaining, the coefficient in the recursive equation is \(0.98\).  With \(50\) iterations of the equation for \(C_n\), we find that the jeans have about \(36\%\) of their original color left after \(50\) washings.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Electrical Power Demand]\label{example-electrical-power-demand}
The amount of electrical power used by a community is increasing by 5% per year.  This year, they used 500 thousand kilowatt-hours of electrical power.  How many years will it take until the electrical power consumption for this community has doubled?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad This is an example of \emph{geometric growth}, since the amount of power is increasing each year. We use the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0=500, P_n=1.05 \cdot P_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
Since the amount of power used is increasing by \(5\%\) each year, next year the citizens of the community will use \(105\%\) of what they used this year.  By iterating the equation for \(P_n\), we find that after \(14\) years the community will use about \(990\) thousand kwh per year and after \(15\) years they will use about \(1039\) thousand kwh per year.  The amount of power required by the community will have doubled in a little less than \(15\) years.  Note that this conclusion assumes that the demand for electrical power continues to increase by \(5\%\) per year.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Radioactive Decay]\label{example-radioactive-decay}
Potassium-42 is a radioactive element that is often used in biological experiments as a tracer element.  Potassium-42, like all radioactive elements, decays into a non-radioactive form at a rate proportional to the amount present.  Potassium-42 loses \(5.545\%\) of its mass every hour.  If \(1\) milligram of potassium-42 is initially present in an animal, at what time will only \(0.1\) milligram be present?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Note that the effect of losing \(5.545\%\) is equivalent to retaining \(94.455\%\). We use the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0=1, P_n=0.94455 \cdot P_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
We are interested in finding the amount of time until \(P_n\) is less than or equal to \(0.1\).  Iterating the equation for \(P_n\), we find that \(P_{40} = 0.1021\) and \(P_{41} = 0.0964\). So after \(40\) hours, \(0.1021\) mg of potassium-42 remain, and after \(41\) hours, \(0.0964\) mg remain. Sometime between \(40\) and \(41\) hours we expect to have only \(0.1\) mg of potassium-42 remaining.%
\par
The recursive system we used to generate amounts of potasium-42 does not allow us to determine the amount present between the \(40^{th}\) hour and the \(41^{st}\) hour.  The amount of potassium-42 changes incrementally between the \(40^{th}\) and the \(41^{st}\) hours, but the recursive equation we have used to represent this phenomenon cannot give us information about potassium levels between \(P_{40}\) and \(P_{41}\).%
\end{example}
Each of the three previous examples uses a recursive system that can be written as%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_0=a,Y_n=(1+k) \cdot Y_{n-1}, n=1,2,3, ...
\end{gather*}
If \(k \gt 0\), this system represents geometric growth (with growth rate \(k\)); as \(n\) increases, the value of \(Y_n\)  increases.  If \(k \lt 0\), the system represents geometric decay (and \(k\) is the decay rate); as \(n\) increases, the value of \(Y_n\)  decreases.  In either case, the next value of \(Y_n\) depends entirely on the value of \(k\) and the old value of \(Y_n\).%
\par
Geometric growth that can be described with a recursive system can also be described by an explicit function.  To demonstrate, we will iterate the system used in Example \hyperref[example-radioactive-decay]{3} to describe electricity consumption%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0=500\\
P_1=(1+0.05)P_0\\
P_2=(1+0.05)P_1\\
P_3=(1+0.05)P_2\\
P_4=(1+0.05)P_3
\end{gather*}
We can rewrite each of these equations in terms of \(P_0\), which yields%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_1=(1.05)P_0\\
P_2=(1.05) P_1=(1.05) (1.05)P_0=(1.05)^2 P_0\\
P_3=(1.05) P_2=(1.05) (1.05)^2 P_0=(1.05)^3 P_0\\
P_4=(1.05) P_3=(1.05) (1.05)^3 P_0=(1.05)^4 P_0
\end{gather*}
If we continue this process, we see that the \(n^{th}\) term is given by%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_n=(1.05)^n P_0
\end{gather*}
In general, we can convert the recursive system for geometric growth or decay, namely%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_0=a,Y_n=(1+k) \cdot Y_{n-1}, n=1,2,3, ...
\end{gather*}
to an explicit function in terms of \(a, k, \)and \(n\), as follows:%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_0=a\\
Y_1=(1+k)Y_0 = (1+k)a\\
Y_2=(1+k)Y_1 = (1+k)(1+k)a = a(1+k)^2\\
Y_3=(1+k)Y_2 = (1+k)a(1+k)^2 = a(1+k)^3
\end{gather*}
If we continue this process, we see that the \(n^{th}\) term is given by%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_n=a(a+k)^n
\end{gather*}
Note the distinction between the recursive equation%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_n=Y_{n-1}(1+k)
\end{gather*}
and the explicit equation%
%
\begin{gather*}
Y_n=a(1+k)^n
\end{gather*}
The recursive equation shows that each value of \(Y_n\)  is obtained from the preceding value by multiplying by \((1+k)\). The explicit equation uses an exponent to represent this repeated multiplication.%
\par
If we wanted the value of \(Y_{100}\), the recursive equation would require that values of \(Y_1, Y_2, Y_3,\) and so forth up to \(Y_{99}\),  all be calculated. In contract, the explicit equaiotn \(Y_n=a(1+k)^n\) allows us to calculate \(Y_{100}\) without requiring any intermediate values.%
\par
The explicit equation can be rewritten using the more traditional functional notation:%
\begin{definition}[{Explicit Function for Geometric Growth}]\label{explicit-geometric-growth-equation}
%
\begin{gather*}
Y(n)=a(1+k)^n
\end{gather*}
\end{definition}
In equation \hyperref[explicit-geometric-growth-equation]{4} the independent variable \(n\) is in the exponent, so this function is an exponential function. The exponential function \(Y(n)=a(1+k)^n\) is the closed form representation of the recursive system  \(Y_0=a,Y_n=(1+k)Y_{n-1}\)%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-one-time-bank-desposit}
Suppose you plan to make a one-time deposit into a bank account that will earn \(0.45\%\) monthly interest.  How large must this deposit be so that you will have a college fund of \(\$75,000\) available after \(18\) years or \(216\) months?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We can solve this problem using the recursive model \(S_0 = a\), \(S_n = (1.0045) S_{n-1}\) but we will have to guess and check to find the appropriate value of \(S_0\) that gives of \(S_{216} = 75,000\).  Using the closed form \(S(n)=a(1.0045)^n\) , we need to find the value of \(a\) such that \(75,000 = a (1.0045)^{216}\).  Solving for \(a\) gives the equation \(a = \frac{75,000}{(1.0045)^{216}}\) , or \(a = \$28,436.36\).  We see that the closed form is useful when we do not need all the intermediate values that the recursive form generates.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Continuous Versus Discrete]\label{example-continuous-discrete}
In Example \hyperref[example-radioactive-decay]{3} we considered the amount of Potassium-42 that remains present during the decay process.  We used the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0=1, P_n=0.94455P_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
to determine the amount of Potassium-42 remaining after \(n\) 1-hour time intervals.%
\par
We could also use the explicit function%
%
\begin{gather*}
P(t)=1 \cdot (0.944355)^t
\end{gather*}
to represent the amount of Potassium-42 remaining \(t\) hours after the decay process begins. Use each of these representations to determine how much Potassium remains after \(12\) hours.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad This is what our work looks like if we use the recursive system:%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0=1\\
P_1=0.94455 \cdot P_0 = 0.94455\\
P_2=0.94455 \cdot P_1 = 0.94455 \cdot 0.94455 = 0.892175\\
P_3=0.94455 \cdot P_2 = 0.94455 \cdot 0.892175 = 0.847036\\
P_4=0.94455 \cdot P_3 = 0.94455 \cdot 0.847036 = 0.7959757\\
...\\
P_{12}=0.94455 \cdot P_{11} = 0.94455 \cdot 0.53392 = 0.5043121
\end{gather*}
If we use the explicit function:%
%
\begin{gather*}
P(12)=1(0.94455)^{12} = 0.5043121
\end{gather*}
Both representations tell us that in \(12\) hours the amount of Potassium-42 will have decreased from \(1\) milligram to about \(0.5\) milligram.%
\par
We need to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each representation that we used in Example \hyperref[example-one-time-bank-desposit]{5}. The recursive system is inherently discrete.  Values of \(P_n\) can be calculated only for positive interger values of \(n\), where n counts the number of \(1\)-hour time intervals that have elapsed since we measured \(1\) milligram of potassium-42. The recursive representation is not able to tell us anything about the amount of potassium present between \(P_2\) and \(P_3\), in fact, \(P_{2.7}\) is not even defined.%
\par
The explicit function \(P(t)=1 \cdot (0.944355)^t\) uses \(t\) as a variable whose domain is all positive real numbers and \(P(2.7)\) is well-defined and meaningful. The explicit function can tell us the amount of Potassium-42 present at any time on the continuum between zero and infinity.%

Note that in the graph on the left, the horizontal scale shows the number of \(1\)-hour time intervals that have elapsed since \(P_0\). On the right, the horizontal scale shows elapsed time. This is consistent with the fact that the recursive system has domain \(n=1,2,3,...\) and the explicit function has domain all positive real numbers.%
\end{example}
Example \hyperref[example-continuous-discrete]{Example~6} shows that we must pay attention to issues of domain when we are choosing between using recursive and explicit representations of a particular phenomenon. Some phenomena by their very nature have a discrete (and thus discontinuous) domain, and these are often best represented recursively. Other phenomena are by nature continuous and may be better represented by an explicit function. Of course, with appropriate care about interpretations, we can choose to use a continuous function to represent a discrete phenomenon.  We can also use a discrete representation for a continuous phenomenon. If we choose to do this, we need to pay particular attention to the way that we interpret our calculations.%

\begin{example}[]\label{example-recursive-salary}
Rebecca starts working for a company at a salary of \(\$40,000\) per year. Based on the company's history, she can expect raises of \(3.5\%\) each year on the anniversary of her employment. When will she first make \(\$50,000\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We can use the recursive system \(A_0=40,000, A_n=1.035A_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...\) to determine when her salary will equal or exceed \(\$50,000\).  Rebecca’s first pay raise will result in a salary of \(\$41,400\).  Her sixth raise will bring her salary up to \(\$49,170.21\) and her seventh raise will put her pay over \(\$50,000\) at \(\$50,891.17\).%
\par
We could also use a closed form function to solve for the time at which her salary will reach \(\$50,000\).  This function is \(S(t)=40,000(1.035)^t\). By evaluating this function, we find that \(S(6)=49,170.21\) and \(S(7)=50,891.17\). Both the recursive model and the closed form model inform us that Rebecca will make more than \(\$50,000\) with her \(7^{th}\) raise.%
\par
If we wanted to know what Rebecca would make if she stayed with this company for \(30\) years, it would be easier to use the closed form and substitute \(t=30\).  In many cases either the recursive system or the closed form could be used to arrive at the same answer. In cases where we need to predict far into the future, it is more efficient to use the closed form. In cases where we want to see all of the intermediate values, as would be the case for the balance due on a loan after each payment, it would be to our advantage to use the recursive system. In Rebecca's case, if we choose to use an explicit representation we must limit the domain to integer values since her pay raises occur only one time per year.%

\begin{example}[Doubling Time]\label{example-doubling-time}
Suppose the population of a certain type of bacteria is known to grow geometrically and increases by about \(26\%\) every hour. How much time will it take for a population of \(150\) million cells to grow to \(300\) million? How long will it take the population to double again to \(600\) million? When will the population reach \(1200\) million (another doubling)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Since the population is growing by \(26\%\) per hour, we can use the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
P_0 = 150, P_n = (1.26)P_{n-1}
\end{gather*}
We also have the option of using the explicit function \(P(t)=150 \cdot (1.26)^t\).  For integer values of \(t\), these two representations give roughly identical values for the number of bacteria cells.%

The population took about \(3\) hours to double from \(150\) to \(300\) million.  In another \(3\) hours, it had doubled again, and in another \(3\) hours there was yet another population doubling. This population is said to have a \emph{doubling time} of \(3\) hours. Note that the first doubling corresponds to an increase of \(150\) cells, the next doubling is an increase of \(300\) cells, and the third doubling is an increase of \(600\) cells. For each of these doublings, the elapsed time is the same (\(3\) hours) but the increase, measured in cells per hour, is not the same.%
\end{example}
Example \hyperref[example-doubling-time]{13} shows that a population that experiences geometric growth has a doubling time. It is also true that populations that experience geometric decay have a \emph{half-life}. A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a population size to be halved. Populations that experience other types of growth, such as linear, quadratic or logistic, do not have a doubling time.%
\par
The exponential function you studied in Chapter 2, \(f(t)=2^t\), has a doubling time of \(1\) time unit. This is because%
%
\begin{gather*}
f(1)=2^1=2\\
f(2)=2^2=4\\
f(3)=2^3=8\\
f(4)=2^4=16
\end{gather*}
A doubling of function-values takes place with each increase of \(1\) unit in \(t\)%
\par
The function \(g(t)=2^{\frac{1}{3} t}\) is a horizontal stretch of the function \(f(t)=2^t\), and this transformation makes \(g(t)\) have a doubling time of \(3\) time units:%
%
\begin{gather*}
g(3)=2^{\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3}=2^1=2\\
g(6)=2^{\frac{1}{3} \cdot 6}=2^2=4\\
g(9)=2^{\frac{1}{3} \cdot 9}=2^3=8
\end{gather*}
Since \(g(t)=2^{\frac{1}{3} t}\) has a doubling time of \(3\) time units, in Example \hyperref[example-doubling-time]{13} we could have used the function \(y = 150 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} t}\) to model the number of bacteria cells present at time \(t\). You can confirm that the two functions \(y = 150 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} t}\) and \(P(t)=150 \cdot (1.26)^t\) produce roughly the same ordered pairs.%

\typeout{Section 4.4 Summing Geometric Growth}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Summing Geometric Growth}]{Summing Geometric Growth}\label{chapter04-section04}
In \(2012\) the world wide rate of crude oil consumption was about \(89,837\) thousand barrels per day and was increasing at an annual rate of about \(1.42\%\) \footnote{SOURCE: www.eia.gov\label{fn-1}}.  As a consequence, the world consumed about \(32.8\) billion barrels of crude oil in \(2012\) and about \(33.3\) billion barrels in \(2013\).  We can use the explicit function \(A(n)=32.8(1.0142)^n\), where \(n\) represents the number of years since \(2012\), to find that the amount of oil consumed in \(2042\) will be a little over \(50\) billion barrels, since \(A(30)=32.8(1.0142)^30 = 50.07\).  That is certainly a large amount, but knowing the amount in any one year does not really tell the whole story.  A more important question:  What is the total amount of crude oil that will be consumed between \(2012\) and \(2042\)?  This total represents the quantity of oil that will be depleted from world oil reserves over this \(31\)-year time period.%
\par
To determine the total amount of oil consumed from \(2012\) to \(2042\), we want to find the sum:%
\begin{gather*}
T=A(0)+A(1)+A(2)+...+A(30)
\end{gather*}
%
\par
We can rewrite the equation for \(T\) as:%
\begin{gather*}
T=32.8+32.8(1.0142)+32.8(1.0142)^2+...+32.8(1.0142)^{30}
\end{gather*}
%
\par
Notice that each term in the sum is \(1.0142\) times the previous term. This sum is an example of a geometric series, which is a sum in which each successive addend is found by multiplying the previous term by some fixed value. Or, put another way, a geometric series is the sum of a geometric sequence.%
\par
A more general way to represent a geometric series is:%
\begin{gather}
S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^n\label{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1}
\end{gather}
%
\par
This series has first term a and each subsequent term is obtained from the preceding term by multiplying by \(r\). The ratio of two consecutive terms in a geometric series is always \(r\), so r is known as the common ratio.%
\par
We can find a formula for the sum of a geometric series without actually adding all of the terms, instead we use algebra in a clever way.  First, we multiply both sides of equation (1) by \(r\), which yields:%
\begin{gather}
Sr = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ... + ar^{n+1}\label{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2}
\end{gather}
%
\par
Most of the terms on the right sides of equations \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1})} and \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2})} are the same.  If we now subtract equation \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2})} from equation \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1})}, meaning we subtract the left side of \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step2})} from the left side of \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step1})} and the same with the right sides, we obtain the new equation:%
\begin{gather*}
S-Sr = a - ar^{n+1}
\end{gather*}
%
\par
Solving this equation to isolate \(S\), we have:%
\begin{gather}
S = \frac{a-ar^{n+1}}{1-r}\label{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3}
\end{gather}
%
\par
Equation \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3})} represents the sum of the terms \(a\) through \(ar^n\) of a geometric series with first term \(a\) and common ratio \(r\), assuming \(r \neq 1\).%
\par
Note that if \(r=1\) the series%
\begin{gather*}
S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^n
\end{gather*}
is equivalent to%
\begin{gather*}
S = a + a + a + a + ... + a
\end{gather*}
and the sum of this series is simply \(S=(n+1)a\)%
\par
Returning to the question regarding world crude oil consumption from \(2012\) through \(2042\), we need to find the sum of terms \(0\) through \(30\) of a geometric series with initial term \(32.8\) and common ratio \(1.0142\) .  This sum is given by%
\begin{gather*}
T = \frac{32.8-32.8(1.0142)^{31}}{1-(1.0142)} \approx 1,266 \text{ billion barrels of oil} 
\end{gather*}
%
\par
In the world’s top \(17\) oil producing countries, estimates of the total proven oil reserves that are recoverable with \(2012\) technology are in the range of \(1200\) to \(1300\) billion barrels.  Therefore, if oil consumption continues to increase at the rate observed in \(2012\), proven oil reserves will be almost exhausted by \(2042\).%
\par
You will encounter a wide variety of situations in mathematics classes and in other disciplines that require finding the sum of a geometric series. This happens frequently enough that you should be sure to include in the collection of mathematical tools you have available to you either the formula for the sum of a geometric series, or the method used here to arrive at that sum.%
\par
Below are two additional examples from the financial world where this concept is used.%
\begin{example}[Value of an Annuity]\label{value-on-an-annuity}
Suppose your parents want to set aside money for college tuition for a younger sibling.  They begin saving when she is twelve by opening an account with an initial deposit of \(\$100\).  At the beginning of each month for six years thereafter, they deposit an additional \(\$100\).  An account into which regular payments are made (or from which regular withdrawals are made) is called \emph{an annuity}.  The account into which they place the money earns \(0.5\%\) monthly interest, which is added to the account at the end of each month.  How much money will be in the account at the end of six years?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The initial deposit earns interest for \(72\) months, which means that in \(72\) months the first \(\$100\) deposited has grown to a value of \(\$100(1.005)^{72}\).  The money deposited at the beginning of the second month earns interest for \(71\) months and grows to \(\$100(1.005)^{71}\).  Each successive deposit earns interest for one month less than the previous deposit.  We will assume that your parents close the account on the day that they make the final payment of \(\$100\); this means that the final \(\$100\) deposit earns no interest.  The timeline in Figure \hyperref[deposit-timeline]{Figure~2} shows each deposit together with the amount of interest earned by each deposit.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{src/images/chapter04-section04-depositchart.png}
\caption{Timeline for interest and deposit in an annuity (REDO GRAPHIC)\label{deposit-timeline}}
\end{figure}
The balance of the annuity after six years is the sum of the values of all 73 deposits, which is%
\begin{gather*}
B = 100 + 100(1.005) + 100(1.005)^2 + 100(1.005)^3 + ... + 100(1.005)^{72}
\end{gather*}
This is a geometric series with initial term \(100\) and common ratio \(1.005\), so we can use equation \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3})} to write the sum of this series as%
\begin{gather}
B= \frac{100-100(1.005)^{73}}{1-1.005}\label{mrow-80}
\end{gather}
which equals \(\$8,784.09\), the balance of the annuity after six years.  Note that only \(\$7,300\) was deposited, so over \(6\) years the deposits have earned over \(\$1,400\) in interest.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Paying Off a Loan]\label{example-12}
Suppose you borrow \(\$20,000\) to buy a car, and you agree to pay back the loan over \(48\) months at \(0.4 \%\) interest per month.  You want to determine the monthly payment \(P\) that you must make in order to pay off the loan. You know how to find the payment using a "guess and check" method.  Now, since you are able to find the sum of a geometric series, you can write and solve an equation to find the payment.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Your outstanding balance can be represented with the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0=20,000, L_n=1.004L_{n-1}-P, n=1,2,3,...
\end{gather*}
Where \(L_n\) is the amount still owed on the loan after \(n\) months and \(P\) is the monthly payment in dollars.  We know that after one month,%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_1=1.004(20,000)-P
\end{gather*}
After two months, the amount still owed is given by%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_2 = 1.004L_1-P
\end{gather*}
which, by substitution is equivalent to%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_2=1.004(1.004 \cdot 20,000 - P) - P\\
\text{or}\\
L_2=1.004^2(20,000)-1.004P-P
\end{gather*}
Similarly, since \(L_3=1.004L_2-P\), we have:%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_3=1.004(1.004^2 (20,000) - 1.004P - P) - P\\
L_3=1.004^3(20,000) - 1.004^2P - 1.004P - P
\end{gather*}
We can continue to iterate to find the outstanding balance after any number of months. For instance,%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_5=1.004^5 (20,000)-1.004^4 P-1.004^3 P-1.004^2 P-1.004P-P
\end{gather*}
In general, we see that after \(n\) months the oustanding balance is given by:%
%
\begin{gather}
L_n=1.004^n (20,000) - P( 1.004^{n-1} + 1.004^{n-2} + ... + 1.004^2 + 1.004 + 1 )\label{general-annuity-formula-long}
\end{gather}
Embedded in the right side of equation \hyperref[general-annuity-formula-long]{(\ref{general-annuity-formula-long})} is the geometric series%
%
\begin{gather*}
1 + 1.004 + 1.004^2 + 1.004^3 + ... + 1.004^{n-2} + 1.004^{n-1}
\end{gather*}
which has first term \(1\) and common ratio \(1.004\). Using equation \hyperref[chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3]{(\ref{chapter04-section04-geoseries-step3})}, we know that%
%
\begin{gather*}
1 + 1.004 + 1.004^2 + 1.004^3 + ... + 1.004^{n-2} + 1.004^{n-1} = \frac{1-1.004^n}{1-1.004}
\end{gather*}
Substituting into equation \hyperref[general-annuity-formula-long]{(\ref{general-annuity-formula-long})} we obtain the following representation for  \(L_n\):%
%
\begin{gather}
L_n = 1.004^n (20,000) - P(\frac{1-1.004^n}{1-1.004})\label{general-annuity-formula-condensed}
\end{gather}
We want \(48\) payments to reduce the outstanding balance to zero, that is, our goal is  \(L_{48}=0\). This means that we can solve the following equation to find the value of \(P\).%
%
\begin{gather*}
0 = 1.004^{48}(20,000)-P(\frac{1-1.004^n}{1-1.004})
\end{gather*}
Solving for \(P\), we find%
%
\begin{gather*}
P = 1.004^{48}(20,000)(\frac{1-1.004^n}{1-1.004})\\
\text{or, equivalently}\\
P=\frac{1.004^{48}(20,000)(0.004)}{1.004^{48}-1}
\end{gather*}
which means that \(P \approx 458.78\). The loan will be paid off in \(48\) months with a monthly payment of \(\$458.78\). You should verify using the recursive system%
%
\begin{gather*}
L_0 = 20,000, L_n = 1.004L_{n-1}, n = 1, 2, 3, ...
\end{gather*}
that the balance after \(48\) payments, \(L_{48}\) is zero. Note that due to rounding, your answer may not be exactly zero. The final baloon payment may be a few cents more or less than \(\$458.78\)%
\par
It is worthwhile to take a moment to study equation \hyperref[general-annuity-formula-condensed]{(\ref{general-annuity-formula-condensed})}, which effectively gives an explicit function for \(L(n)\).%
%
\begin{gather*}
L(n) = 1.004^n (20,000) - P(\frac{1-1.004^n}{1-1.004})
\end{gather*}
Recall that the monthly interest rate was \(0.4\%\), the amount borrowed was \(\$20,000\),  \(L(n)\) is the amount still owed after \(n\) payments, and \(P\) is the monthly payment. You should conclude that if the monthly interest rate is k\% and the amount borrowed is \(\$A\), then \(L(n)\), the amount still owed after \(n\) payments, will be given by%
%
\begin{gather}
L(n) = (1+k)^n A - P(\frac{1-(1+k)^n}{1-(1+k)})\label{mrow-100}
\end{gather}
If you want the outstanding balance to be zero after \(n^*\) months, you can solve to find the value of \(P\) for which \(L(n^*)=0\).%

\typeout{Section 4.5 Compound Interest (or the Magic of Compounding)}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Compound Interest (or the Magic of Compounding)}]{Compound Interest (or the Magic of Compounding)}\label{chapter04-section05}
In the previous section, we encountered a situation in which money was deposited into an interest-bearing account, and the interest was added to the account at regular intervals.  For example, suppose Maria deposits \(\$1,000\) in an account that earns interest at a rate of \(5\%\) annually.  After one year, the balance of the account will increase to \(\$1,050\).  After two years the balance will be \(\$1,102.50\) and so on according to the recursive equation%
%
\begin{gather*}
A_n = A_{n-1} + 0.05 A_{n-1}
\end{gather*}
where \(A_n\) is the account balance after \(n\) years. \(A_n\) is known as the \emph{future value} of the initial deposit of \(\$1,000\) after \(n\) years.  The interest in Maria's account is \emph{compounded annually}, which means that the interest that has been earned during a year is credited to the account at the end of that year.%
\par
Rather than adding earned interest into an account at the end of each year, financial institutions often use quarterly, monthly, or daily compounding.  For example, a bank that compounds monthly would add one month's interest into the account at the end of every month. As a consequence, during the second month, the initial deposit and the first month's interest will both earn interest.  During the third month, the initial deposit and two months of interest payments will earn interest.%
\par
What effect does the frequency of compounding have on the future value of Maria's \(\$1,000\) deposit?  We will rely on the formula \(I=prt\), where \(I\) is the amount of interest earned in one compounding time period, \(p\) the principal, \(r\) the annual interest rate, and \(t\) the time (in years) between successive compoundings. We see that at the end of the first month, the amount of interest earned is \(I=1000 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 1/12 \approx 4.17\)  The account balance after one month is%
%
\begin{gather*}
\$1,000 + \$1,000(0.05) \frac{1}{12} = \$1,000 ( 1 + \frac{0.05}{12}) = \$1,004.17
\end{gather*}
At the end of the second month, the account has a balance of%
%
\begin{gather*}
\$1,004.17(1 + \frac{0.05}{12}) = \$1,008.35
\end{gather*}
At the end of the third month, the account has a balance of%
%
\begin{gather*}
\$1,008.35 (1 + \frac{0.05}{12}) = \$1,012.55
\end{gather*}
At the end of the first year, which contains twelve compounding periods, the balance will be%
%
\begin{gather*}
\$1,000 (1 + \frac{0.05}{12})^{12} = \$1,051.16
\end{gather*}
Notice that this amount is higher than the balance of \(\$1,050.00\) that we expect at the end of one year using annual compounding. This increased balance is the result of Maria earning interest on interest payments that have been deposited into the account during the year.%
\begin{example}[Investment Accounts]\label{chapter04-section05-investment-accounts}
Financial institutions often offer a variety of investment accounts from which their customers can choose.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-98}{}What will be Felix’s account balance after \(1\) year if he deposits \(\$100\) in an account that pays \(5\%\) annual interest that is compounded quarterly? What annual interest rate, compounded only one time per year, would result in the same account balance?%
\item\hypertarget{li-99}{}What will be Felix’s account balance after \(1\) year if he deposits \(\$100\) in an account that pays \(4.9\%\) annual interest that is compounded daily? What annual interest rate, compounded only one time per year, would result in the same account balance?%
\item\hypertarget{li-100}{}Would Felix be better off investing money in an account that earns \(5.1\%\) annual interest that is compounded annually, or an account that earns \(5\%\) that is compounded every hour?%
\end{enumerate}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-101}{}If \(5\%\) annual interest is compounded quarterly (four times per year) then the account balance is multiplied by \((1+\frac{0.05}{4})\) each quarter. The account balance after \(n\) quarters is given by \(A(n)=100(1+\frac{0.05}{4})^n\). After \(1\) year, the balance will be \(A(4)=100(1+\frac{0.05}{4})^4 \approx \$105.09\). Felix would have ended up with the same account balance if he earned an interest rate of \(5.09\%\) that was compounded once per year.%
\item\hypertarget{li-102}{}When \(4.9\%\) annual interest is compounded daily (\(365\) times per year) the balance after \(n\) days is given by  \(A(n)=100(1+\frac{0.049}{365})^n\). After \(1\) year, the balance will be \(A(365) = 100(1+\frac{0.049}{365})^{365} \approx \$105.02\). An annual interest rate of \(5.02\%\) compounded once per year would have yielded the same balance as \(4.9\%\) compounded daily.%
\item\hypertarget{li-103}{}Felix can compare these accounts even if he does not know how much money he has to invest or how much time he will leave his money in the account.  Use \(A\) to represent his initial deposit.  If \(5.1\%\) interest is compounded once per year, his balance is multiplied by \((1.051)\) every year, and after \(n\) years his balance will be \(A(1.051)^n\) dollars. Now consider \(5\%\) annual interest being compounded every hour.  Since each compounding period is \(\frac{1}{8760}\) year, his balance is multiplied by \((1+\frac{0.05}{8760})\) every hour. Since there are \(8760\) hours in a year, the account balance is multiplied by \((1+\frac{0.05}{8760})^{8760}\) every year. Note that \((1 + \frac{0.05}{8760} )^{8760} \approx 1.0513\), so after \(n\) years Felix’s account balance will be \(A(1.0513)^n\) dollars. Felix is better off investing in the account that pays \(5\%\) interest compounded hourly because \(A(1.0513)^n > A(1.051)^n\) for all positive values of \(A\) and of \(n\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
The different interest rates and compounding frequencies in Example \hyperref[chapter04-section05-investment-accounts]{Example~1} highlight the need for a way to compare these accounts. In part (a) we saw that \(5\%\) compounded quarterly has the same “effect” on an account balance as \(5.09\%\) compounded once per year. So we call \(5.09\%\) the \emph{effective annual yield}, or \emph{effective annual interest rate} of \(5\%\) compounded quarterly.  It is the interest rate that if compounded only once per year would yield the same balance as another rate with more frequent compounding. In part (b) we saw that \(4.8\%\) annual interest compounded daily has an effective annual yield of \(5.02\%\). In (c), we saw that \(5\%\) annual interest compounded once per hour has an effective annual yield of \(5.13\%\).%

\caption{Impact of the Frequency of Compounding\label{impact-of-compounding-table}}
\end{table}
Reading down any column of Figure \hyperref[impact-of-compounding-table]{Table~2}, we notice that the future value increases as the number of years increases.  This is to be expected. But reading across any row reveals that the future value seems to level off as the frequency of compounding increases.  For any number of years, there appears to be an upper limit to the future value of the account. We see that increasing the frequency of compounding is associated with an increase in the future value, but we don’t expect the future values associated with compounding “by the second” to be appreciably larger than the values displayed in the right-most column of the table for “by the minute” compounding.%
\par
Each entry in Figure \hyperref[impact-of-compounding-table]{Table~2} can be calculated with the explicit function%
%
\begin{gather*}
A(N)=1,000((1 + \frac{0.05}{k})^k)^N \text{or} A(N) = 1000(1 + \frac{0.05}{k})^{kN}
\end{gather*}
where \(A(N)\) is the future value of \(N\) years.%
\par
The value of \(N\) is fixed in each row of Figure \hyperref[impact-of-compounding-table]{Table~2}, in the first row \(N=1\), in the second \(N=10\), and so on.  This means that increases in the future values in a particular row result solely from the value of the expression \((1+\frac{0.05}{k})^k\).  Since the future values associated with each value of \(N\) appear to have a limit, we suspect that the quantity \((1+\frac{0.05}{k})^k\) has some limiting value as \(k\) becomes very large.  Figure \hyperref[impact-of-k]{Table~3} provides values of this quantity for \(k\)-values associated with increasing frequency of compounding.  Correct to six decimal places, the limiting value appears to be \(1.051271\)%

\caption{Values of \((1+\frac{1.00}{k})^k\) rounded to six decimal places\label{discovery-of-e}}
\end{table}
Mathematicians began exploring the behavior of \((1+\frac{1}{k})^k\) early in the eighteenth century.  In essence they found that the value of \((1+\frac{1}{k})^k\) approaches a limiting value as \(k\) gets larger and larger.  Mathematicians define this limiting value, which is \(2.71828...\), as the number \(e\) in honor of the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.  In mathematical notation, we can write%
%
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{k})^k = e 
\end{gather*}
which is read, “the limit of \((1 + \frac{1}{k})^k\) as \(k\) approaches infinity is the number \(e\).”%
\par
Based on the numerical values in Figure \hyperref[impact-of-k]{Table~3}, we see that \((1 + \frac{0.05}{k})^k\) approaches a limiting value of about \(1.051271\) as \(k\) approaches infinity. You can use a calculator to confirm that this value is equal to \(e^0.05\). We write%
%
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} (1 + \frac{0.05}{k})^k = e^{0.05}
\end{gather*}
We can also use a calculator to compare the values of \(e^{0.02}\) and \((1 + \frac{0.02}{k})^k\) for large values of \(k\), as well as several more values of \(r\).  What we find supports the statement:%
%
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} (1 + \frac{r}{k})^k = e^r
\end{gather*}
Based on the relationship between limiting values and \(e\), we can use the exponential function with base \(e\) to arrive at useful and accurate approximations for future values when interest is compounded frequently.  For example, if \(3.2\%\) annual interest is compounded \(5,000\) times per year, the future value in \(N\) years of an initial deposit of \(\$1,000\) is \(\$1,000(1+\frac{0.032}{5000})^{5000N}\) which can be approximated by \(\$1,000e^{0.032N}\).  When this approximation is used, the future values are the result of \emph{continuous compounding.}  It is useful to think of continuous compounding as compounding that occurs at every instant. It may be physically impossible to add interest into an account in a way that is truly continuous, but continuous compounding refers to the limiting case of compounding that is more and more frequent.%
\par
The equation%
%
\begin{gather*}
\text{Future Value} = A_0 (e^r)^N = A_0 e^{rN}
\end{gather*}
gives the balance after \(N\) years in an account with continuous compounding, initial deposit , and annual interest rate \(r\).  Note that since the compounding is continuous, the future value changes with any change in time, no matter how small, so it is reasonable to substitute any positive real number for \(N\).%
\par
The continuous function \(F(N)=A_0 e^{rN}\) describing the future value of an account with continuous compounding is an example of an important class of functions known as exponential functions.  All exponential functions are transformations of the exponential function \(y=e^x\).  This function is closely related to the tool-kit function \(y=2^x\) and can be used to describe many "real-world" situations, from the cooling of coffee sitting on a table to the increase of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere.  Over the next several sections of this chapter, you will become more aquatinted with this important function and the situations in which it is a useful model.%

%
\begin{gather*}
A(1 + R) = A (1 + \frac{r}{k})^k

\item\hypertarget{li-109}{}Make a scatterplot of the set of ordered pairs \((\text{rate}, \text{time to double})\). For example, if you found that a \(5.8\%\) interest rate compounded monthly takes \(12.9\) years to double, you would have the ordered pair \((5.8, 12.9)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-110}{}Based on the shape of your scatterplot, identify a toolkit function that would be a good model for your scatterplot.  \emph{Hint:} An exponential function would NOT be a good model%

\par\smallskip
\item[9.]\hypertarget{athletic-contract}{}The amount of money that would have to be invested today to yield some specified amount in the future is called the \emph{present value} of that future amount.  (In exercise 8 you found the present value of \(\$50,000\) to be paid in eighteen years.)  Suppose a professional athlete signs a one-year contract for \(\$2,000,000\) and agrees to be paid over a period of five years.  At the beginning of each of the next five years he or she will be paid \(\$400,000\).  What is the present value of this contract assuming a \(6\%\) interest rate compounded annually?  Another way to ask this question is: how much money should the team management deposit in an account earning \(6\%\) annual interest when the contract is signed to guarantee that they can pay this five-year deal?  Since the athlete is paid at the beginning of each year, assume that the present value of the first payment of \(\$400,000\) is \(\$400,000\).%
