<p>Your task is to determine what his monthly payment needs to be. You will make several educated guesses about how much he needs to pay each month in order to finish paying off the loan and bring his outstanding balance down to zero with \(72\) payments.
           </p>
<ol id="ol-15" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-54">In a table like the one shown, record the size of the monthly payment and the balance Terry still owes at the end of 72 months. The first row of the table has been completed. It indicates that if Terry makes a payment of \(\$950\) each month, he will have overpaid by about \(\$6,900\) after the \(72^{nd}\) payment. <figure class="figure-like" id="table-5"><table>
