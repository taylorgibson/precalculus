<p>Drugs generally have a therapeutic range rather than a single therapeutic level.  In other words, a drug is effective if the level in the body is between two values.  At concentrations below this range, too little of the drug is present to have a measurable effect, and concentrations above this range may be toxic.  The level of drug in the body peaks just after the drug is taken, while the drug level is at a minimum just before the dosage is taken.  Suppose Joan takes an anti-inflammatory drug at the prescribed dosage of 440 mg every 12 hours and her kidneys filter \(60\%\) of the drug from her body every 12 hours.  Use tables and graphs to investigate the following:
               </p>
<ol id="ol-9" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-31">Generate a sequence of values for the level of drug in Joan’s body just before each dose.</li>
<li id="li-32">In the long-run, the level of drug in Joan’s body will range  between what two values?</li>
<li id="li-33">Suppose the therapeutic range of the anti-inflammatory drug is between 300 mg and 800 mg.  What adjustment, if any, needs to be made in Joan’s dosage to stay within this range in the long run?</li>
</ol>
