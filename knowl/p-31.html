<p>Suppose you are interested in purchasing a car and need a \(\$10,000\) loan. The lending agency is going to charge you interest each month and you are going to make a payment each month. You plan to pay \(\$230\) each month until the loan is paid off. Suppose the interest rate is \(0.45\%\) per month (approximately \(5.4\%\) per year). How long will it take you to repay the loan? What is the total amount you will have to repay?  You can answer these questions using recursion.</p>
