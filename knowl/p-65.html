<p>Terry has his heart set on owning a Tesla electric car. He will sell his current car to raise some of the money, but still needs to take out a \(\$55,000\) loan to be able to afford a Tesla. His credit union will charge him \(4.2\%\) interest per year, a special rate for an energy efficient car. He will make equal monthly payments in order to pay off the loan in \(72\) months.</p>
