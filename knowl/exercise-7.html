<p id="p-25">One of the primary responsibilities of the manager of a swimming pool is to maintain the proper concentration of chlorine in the swimming pool.  The concentration should be between 1 and 2 parts per million (ppm).  If the concentration gets as high as 3 ppm swimmers experience burning eyes.  If the concentration gets below 1 ppm, the water will become cloudy, which is unappealing.  If it drops below 0.5 ppm, algae begin to grow.  During a period of one day, \(15\%\) of the chlorine present in the pool dissipates (mainly due to the sun). </p>
<ol id="ol-7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-21">If the chlorine content starts at 2.5 ppm and no additional chlorine is added, how long will it be before the water becomes cloudy?</li>
<li id="li-22">If the chlorine content starts at 2.5 ppm and the equivalent of 0.5 ppm of chlorine is added daily, what will happen to the level of chlorine in the pool in the long run?</li>
<li id="li-23">If the chlorine content starts at 2.5 ppm and the equivalent of 0.1 ppm of chlorine is added daily, what will happen to the level of chlorine in the pool in the long run?</li>
<li id="li-24">How much chlorine must be added daily for the chlorine level to stabilize at 1.8 ppm?</li>
