<p id="p-48">Referring to equation XX we have</p>
\begin{gather*}
L_0=22,000,L_n=(1+0.065)L_{n-1}-P
\end{gather*}
<p id="p-49">and our goal is to find the value of \(P\) so that \(L_4=0\)</p>
<p id="p-50">If there were no interest charged, you would have to make a payment of \(\$5,500\) each year to repay the \(\$22,000\text{.}\)  Since you must pay interest on the loan, \(\$5,500\) per year is obviously too small a payment and we conclude that \(\&gt; \$5,500\text{.}\)  We can confirm that \(\$5,500\) is too small a payment  with the recursive system:</p>
\begin{gather*}
L_0=22,000,L_n=(1+0.065)L_{n-1} - 5,500

</table></figure><p id="p-51">This confirms that if we make an annual payment of \(\$5,500\) for each of 4 years, the outstanding balance on a loan of \(\$22,000\) is \(\$4,062.80\) at the end of the \(4\) years. So \(\$5,500\) is too small an annual payment to pay off the loan.</p>
<p id="p-52">With a \(6.5\%\) annual interest rate, we know that the interest for the first year is \(\$1,430\) ( \(6.5\%\) of \(\$22,000\) ), so a reasonable guess for the payment might be \(\$5500+\$1430=\$6930\text{.}\) However, in the second year we will need to pay less than \(\$1430\) in interest because the outstanding balance has decreased.  Therefore, a payment of \(\$6930\) per year will result in an overpayment for the last three years.  The calculations below show that \(\$6930\) is indeed too large an annual payment; that is, \(P &lt; 6,930\text{.}\)</p>

<p id="p-58">We can continue the process of averaging two payments, one that is too large and one that is too small.
