<p>If we continue the payments of \(\$230\) for four years (48 months), the final payment will probably not bring the outstanding balance to exactly zero dollars.  Although it is possible to calculate a loan payment that will exactly pay off the loan in 48 equal payments, it is common practice for the lender to make all of the payments, except for the last one, a whole dollar amount, or even round these payments to the nearest five or ten-dollar amounts. Doing this will almost certainly make the final payment different from the rest.  This final payment is known as the balloon payment</p>
