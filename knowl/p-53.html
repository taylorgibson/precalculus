<p>We have established that \(\$5500\) is too small a payment and \(\$6930\) is too large a payment; that is, \(5,500 &lt; P &lt; 6,930\)  Our next logical guess for a payment might be mid-way between these two payments, or \(\$6215\text{.}\).  We can do recursive calculations to see if this payment is too small, which would result in a positive outstanding balance after \(4\) years, or if this payment is too large, resulting in a negative outstanding balance after \(4\) years.</p>
