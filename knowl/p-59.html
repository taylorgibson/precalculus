<p>The process used to find an appropriate payment is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>binary search</em>. We began the process by finding an interval that contained the appropriate payment. This interval is bounded by a payment that is too low and a payment that is too high. We found the midpoint of the interval and determined if that payment was too large or too small.  If the "midpoint payment" is too high, that is, if we have a negative balance after four payments, then consider a new interval that is the lower half of the previous interval; otherwise, take the new interval to be the upper half of the previous interval We continue bisecting, which results in a smaller and smaller interval that we know contains the appropriate payment.  We stop bisecting the interval as soon as we have found a payment that results in a balance of zero, or as close to zero as we need.</p>
