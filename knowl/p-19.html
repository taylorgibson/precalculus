<p>The points shown in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-plot-ibuprofen-multi-dose.html" knowl-id="xref-figure-plot-ibuprofen-multi-dose" alt="Figure  " title="Figure  "></a> represent the amount of the drug in Joan’s body immediately after she takes a tablet.  Between consecutrive doses, we know that the level of the drug declines.  We assume that the level “jumps up” at the moment she takes another tablet, and the recursive system enables us to compute these values.   If we  record the drug levels only after she takes a tablet, then we see that these values reach an equilibrium of approximately 298.51 mg.  To see why this equilibrium has been reached, consider how much of the 298.51 mg of the drug will be filtered in four hours.  Joan’s kidneys will filter out \(67\%\) of the 298.51 mg in her body, or approximately 200 mg, which will be replaced when she takes the next tablet. Equilibrium occurs because the amount of drug taken into the body is the same as the amount filtered prior to taking the next tablet.</p>
