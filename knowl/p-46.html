<p>When borrowers take out a loan, they typically know the amount they want to borrow, the interest rate they will have to pay, and the length of time they have to pay off the loan.  We are interested in determining the payment that will allow the borrower to pay back the loan in the required time.  For most loans, the borrower makes payments every month. Thus, a car loan that needs to be repaid in \(5\) years requires \(60\) monthly payments and a mortgage loan that is repaid in \(15\) years requires \(180\) monthly payments. For simplicity's sake, our first few examples will assume that payments are made annually (that is, once per year) rather than monthly.</p>
