<p>A company has \(\$10,000\) worth of equipment and for tax purposes they want to figure the depreciation of the equipment over a 10-year time period.  One method is to reduce the value each year by the same dollar amount.  A second method is to decrease the value of the equipment each year by the same percent of the current value each year.
                  </p>
<ol id="ol-6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-19">Using the first method, generate a table and graph for the value of the equipment if it is  decreased each year by \(\$2000\text{.}\)</li>
<li id="li-20">Using the second method, generate a table and graph for the value of the equipment if it is decreased by \(20\%\) each year.</li>
</ol>
