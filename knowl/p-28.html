<p>Suppose Morgan  wants to buy a television that costs \(\$549\text{.}\).  He has a part-time job, and he is able to save \(\$85.00\) each week.  Suppose he accumulates the money at home.
              </p>
<ol id="ol-10" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-34">Write a recursive system that can be used to determine how much Morgan has saved over time.</li>
<li id="li-35">Use the recursive system to generate values for the amount of money Morgan has saved in thirteen weeks.</li>
<li id="li-36">Make a graph to show the amount Morgan has saved versus the number of weeks he has been saving.</li>
<li id="li-37">The points graphed in part (c) should appear linear.  Explain why the situation implies that these ordered pairs are linear.</li>
<li id="li-38">Write an explicit function of the form \(A=f(t)\) that could be used to generate the same ordered pairs you graphed in part (c).</li>
<li id="li-39">State the domain and the range of the explicit function within the context of this problem.  Compare them to the domain and range of the recursively defined function.</li>
</ol>
