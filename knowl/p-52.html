<p>With a \(6.5\%\) annual interest rate, we know that the interest for the first year is \(\$1,430\) ( \(6.5\%\) of \(\$22,000\) ), so a reasonable guess for the payment might be \(\$5500+\$1430=\$6930\text{.}\). However, in the second year we will need to pay less than \(\$1430\) in interest because the outstanding balance has decreased.  Therefore, a payment of \(\$6930\) per year will result in an overpayment for the last three years.  The calculations below show that \(\$6930\) is indeed too large an annual payment; that is, \(P &lt; 6,930\text{.}\).</p>
