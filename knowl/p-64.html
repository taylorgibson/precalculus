<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
<p>Kyle and Taylor have taken out a loan for \(\$175,000\) to buy their first house. They have a \(15\)-year mortgage and an annual interest rate of \(3.9\%\text{.}\).
             </p>
<ol id="ol-14" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-52">The lending agency tells them that their monthly payment is \(\$1,290\text{,}\) and so they pay \(\$1,290\) every month for \(179\) months. What must be their final payment (the \(180^{th}\)) so that the loan is paid off?  In total, how much did it cost them to borrow \(\$175,000\) for \(15\) years?</li>
<li id="li-53">Kyle and Taylor recognize that they may save money in the long run if they make payments larger than what the lending agency requires. They decide to pay \(\$2,000\) for the first \(5\) years (\(60\) months) and then pay the required \(\$1,290\) per month until the loan is paid off. How long will it take them to bring their outstanding balance to zero. In total, how much did it cost them to borrow \(\$175,000\) for \(15\) years?</li>
