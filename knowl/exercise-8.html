<p id="p-26">The Fish and Wildlife Division monitors the trout population in a stream that is under their jurisdiction.  Their research indicates that natural predators, together with pollution and fishing, are causing the trout population to decrease at a rate of \(20\%\) per month.  They propose to introduce additional trout into the stream each month.  Assume the current population is 300.  Use tables and graphs to investigate the following: </p>
<ol id="ol-8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="li-25">What will happen to the trout population over the next ten months with no replenishment program?</li>
<li id="li-26">What is the long-term result of introducing 100 trout into the stream each month?</li>
<li id="li-27">Investigate the result of changing the number of trout introduced each month.  What is the impact on the long-term population of the number of trout added each month?</li>
<li id="li-28">Investigate the impact on the long-term behavior of the population of changing the initial population.  What is the effect of the initial population?</li>
<li id="li-29">What is the impact of the rate of decrease in the population during the replenishment program?</li>
<li id="li-30">There are three parameters in this problem: the initial number of trout, the rate of decrease, and the number of trout added each month. Which parameter seems to have the most influenceon the long-term behavior? Explain briefly.</li>
