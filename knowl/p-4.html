<p>In a previous chapter we learned that a function is a special sets of ordered pairs.  In most of the examples in the preceeding chapters, functions were described by an algebraic expression that could be evaluated for a particular input value resulting in a unique output value. Such algebraic expressions are called closed form or explicit expressions.  For these functions, the relationship \(y=f(x)\) is used to show how the \(y\)-value is related to the given \(x\)-value. For example, the function \(f(x)=x^2+6x\) is an explicit function. This notation tells us that any particular numerical value for \(x\) is paired with the \(y\)-value equal to \(x^2+6x\text{.}\). So 1 is paired with 7, since \(f(1)=(1)^2+6(1)=7\) , and \(-3\) is paired with \(-9\text{,}\), since \(f(-3)=(-3)^2+6(-3)=-9\text{.}\).</p>
