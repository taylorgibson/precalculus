<p>An annual payment of \(\$6,215\) is not sufficient to pay off the loan in four years, as a balance of \(\$911.67\) remains after the four payments.  We conclude that \(6,215 &lt; P &lt; 6,930\) and we need to pay more than \(\$6,215\text{.}\).  If we again select the average of two payments, one that is too large and one that is too small, we will have arrived at a better guess.  We know \(\$6,930\) is too large and \(\$,6215\) is too small, so our next guess will be \(\frac{6930+6215}{2} = \$6,572.50\text{.}\).  The successive balances would now be as shown.</p>
