<p>Joan has a headache and decides to take a 200mg ibuprofen tablet for pain relief.  The drug is absorbed into her system and stays in her system until the drug is metabolized and filtered out by the liver and kidneys.  Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized.  Every four hours, Joan's body removes \(67\%\) of the ibuprofen that was in her body at the beginning of that four-hour time period.  How much of the ibuprofen will remain in her system \(24\) hours after taking the \(200\)mg tablet?</p>
