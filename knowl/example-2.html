</h5>
<p id="p-16">Joan strained her knee playing tennis and her doctor has prescribed ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and control pain.  Joan is instructed to take two 200-milligram ibuprofen tablets every 4 hours for three days.  Joan doesn’t like taking medicine, so she decides to take only one tablet every four hours for six days.  After the six days, Joan’s knee has not responded to the medication.  Naturally, she knew that the knee would take longer to respond to the reduced treatment, but she did not expect no response at all.  What could have happened?</p></article><div class="posterior"><div><a knowl="./knowl/solution-2.html" knowl-id="xref-solution-2" alt="Solution 4.1.3.1 " title="Solution 4.1.3.1 ">Solution</a></div></div>
