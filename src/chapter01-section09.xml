  <title>Standard Deviation</title>
    <p>
      We see in FIGURE XX in Section 3 that <m>\left( 2.5, 2.5 \right)</m> is the point on the line <m>y = x</m> closest to the point <m>\left( 1, 4 \right)</m>. A natural question to ask is, "what is that shortest distance?" To answer this question, we again use the distance formula. This shortest distance found by the least squares criterion is
      <md>
        <mrow>d = \sqrt{ \left( 1 - 2.5 \right)^2 + \left( 4 - 2.5 \right)^2} = \sqrt{ 4.5 } \approx 2.121</mrow>
      </md>

      This distance between the mean point and the data point is a measure of how close the two points are, and since the mean point using all the same values for each coordinate, it also measures how close to the mean the individual components of the data are. That is, it contributes information about the spread, or variability, of the data. We saw that the mean is a least-squares measure of the “center” of data, and we interpret the value of the mean as the size of a "typical" value. To describe the spread or variability of the data, we continue with a the least-squares (distance formula) approach and use the standard deviation, <m>s</m>, as our measure of spread.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational formula for the standard deviation is <m>s = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right) ^2 }{ n - 1 } }</m>. We will not be using this equation to make computations, all of our computations will be done automatically on the calculator or computer, but the equation gives us important information about what the standard deviation is measuring.  Notice that the numerator, <m>\sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right) ^2 }</m>, is the length of the line segment from the point defined by the data to the point <m>\left( \bar{x}, \bar{x}, \bar{x}, ..., \bar{x}, \right)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We saw that for the data <m>\left\{ 2,3,7 \right\}</m> the mean of <m>4</m> minimizes the distance between the points <m>\left( 2,3,7 \right)</m> and the line <m>x = y = z</m>. That is, the point <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> is the closest to <m>\left( 2, 3, 7 \right)</m>. The distance between <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> and <m>\left( 2, 3, 7 \right)</m> is  <m>d_1 = \sqrt{ (2-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (7-4)^2 } = \sqrt{14} \approx 3.74</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compare the data <m>\left\{ 2,3,7 \right\}</m> and <m>\left\{ 1, 3, 8 \right\}</m> to <m>\left\{ 2,3,7 \right\}</m>. All three sets have means of <m>4</m>, so they would all be represented by <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m>. However, <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> is farther from <m>\left( 1, 3, 8 \right)</m> and closer to <m>\left( 3, 3, 6 \right)</m> than it is to <m>\left( 2, 3, 7 \right)</m>. We see that <m>d_2 = \sqrt{ (1-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (8-4)^2 } = \sqrt{26} \approx 5.099</m> while <m>d_3= \sqrt{ (3-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (6-4)^2 } = \sqrt{6} \approx 2.45</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>\left( 3, 3, 6 \right)</m> is closer to <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m>, than <m>\left( 2, 3, 7 \right)</m> we also know that <m>\left\{ 3, 3, 6 \right\}</m> is less variable than <m>\left\{ 2, 3, 7 \right\}</m>; the point are closer to <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> because the coordinates are closer together. In general, the length of the segment between <m>\left( x_1,x_2,x_3 \right)</m> and <m>\left( \bar{x}, \bar{x}, \bar{x} \right)</m> is a "natural" measure of how spread out is the data, and this length is the numerator in the expression for the standard deviation of the data set <m>\left\{ x_1,x_2,x_3 \right\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what about the denominator <m>\sqrt{n - 1}</m> in the definition of the standard deviation? What's it doing there? While the length of the segment between <m>\left( x_1,x_2,x_3 \right)</m> and <m>\left( \bar{x}, \bar{x}, \bar{x} \right)</m> is a good way to compare sets where both sets have <m>3</m> data points, it suffers when comparing sets with an unequal number of data points. Remember, the distance formula sums squares, which are non-negative numbers. The more numbers being added, the larger the sum is expected to be. So, knowing the distance is, for example <m>50</m> units, doesn’t tell us all we need to know. If three squares add to <m>50</m>, they should be fairly large, but if <m>40</m> squares add to <m>50</m>, they are each likely quite small. The standard deviation tries to estimate the typical size of a summand in the distance formula.
    </p>

    <p>
      We saw that the mean of <m>\left\{ 2, 3, 7 \right\}</m> was <m>4</m>. Now, consider the data set <m>\left\{ 2, 3, 4, 4, 4 ,4, 4, 4, 4, 7 \right\}</m>. This set also has a mean of <m>4</m>, and the distances between the points <m>\left( 2, 3, 7 \right)</m> and <m>\left( 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> and the points <m>\left( 2, 3, 4, 4, 4 ,4, 4, 4, 4, 7 \right)</m> and <m>\left( 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ,4, 4, 4, 4 \right)</m> are both <m>\sqrt{14}</m>. But the individual components making up the sum of squares are, on average, much smaller for the larger data set, so we consider <m>\left\{ 2, 3, 4, 4, 4 ,4, 4, 4, 4, 7 \right\}</m> to be less variable (or more consistent). In one case we compare <m>3</m> values and get a total length of <m>\sqrt{14}</m>, while in the other case, we have <m>10</m> values and get a total length of <m>\sqrt{14}</m>.  By dividing by <m>\sqrt{n-1}</m>, we take into account the number of data values used in the sums of squares. Just why we divide by <m>\sqrt{n-1}</m> instead of <m>\sqrt{n}</m> or some other function of <m>n</m> requires some knowledge of statistics and linear algebra, which are well beyond this course. But, rest assured, there are good reasons for this and the applications of the standard deviation abound in higher mathematics.

        In Section XX (1.3) we considered the average ACT scores by state for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The mean for this data set is <m>\bar{x} = 21.32</m> and the standard deviation is <m>s = 1.75</m>. In the dotplot below, discuss the proportion of scores observed within one standard deviation of the mean and within two standard deviations of the mean.
