	<title>Some Thoughts About Models and Mathematics</title>

		<p>When children think about models, they generally consider some kind of a toy, perhaps an airplane or a dinosaur.</p>

		<p>An element <m>p/q \in {\mathbb Q}</m> is the quotient of two integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>; however, different pairs of integers can represent the same rational number.  For instance, <m>1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6</m>. We know that 
			<me>\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}</me>
		if and only if <m>ad = bc</m>. A more formal way of considering this problem is to examine fractions in terms of equivalence relations.  We can think of elements in <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> as ordered pairs in <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m>.  A quotient <m>p/q</m> can be written as <m>(p, q)</m>.  For instance, <m>(3, 7)</m> would represent the fraction <m>3/7</m>.  However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m>.  There is no fraction <m>5/0</m> corresponding to the pair <m>(5,0)</m>.  Also, the pairs <m>(3,6)</m> and <m>(2,4)</m> both represent the fraction <m>1/2</m>.  The first problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to be nonzero.  The second problem is solved by considering two pairs <m>(a, b)</m> and <m>(c, d)</m> to be equivalent if <m>ad = bc</m>.</p>

		<p>If we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral domains in general.  Let <m>D</m> be any integral domain and let 
			<me>S = \{ (a, b) : a, b \in D \mbox{ and } b \neq 0 \}.</me>
		Define a relation on <m>S</m> by <m>(a, b) \sim (c, d)</m> if <m>ad=bc</m>.</p>

		<lemma>
			<statement>
				<p>The relation <m>\sim</m> between elements of <m>S</m> is an equivalence relation.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>Since <m>D</m> is commutative, <m>ab = ba</m>; hence, <m>\sim</m> is reflexive on <m>D</m>. Now suppose that <m>(a,b) \sim (c,d)</m>. Then <m>ad=bc</m> or <m>cb = da</m>. Therefore, <m>(c,d) \sim (a, b)</m> and the relation is symmetric. Finally, to show that the relation is transitive, let <m>(a, b) \sim (c, d)</m> and <m>(c, d) \sim (e,f)</m>. In this case <m>ad = bc</m> and <m>cf = de</m>. Multiplying both sides of <m>ad=bc</m> by <m>f</m> yields
					<me>a f d = a d f = b c f = b d e = bed.</me>
				Since <m>D</m> is an integral domain, we can deduce that <m>af = be</m> or <m>(a,b ) \sim (e, f)</m>.</p>
			</proof>
		</lemma>
 
		<p>We will denote the set of equivalence classes on <m>S</m> by <m>F_D</m>. We now need to define the operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m>.  Recall how fractions are added and multiplied in <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>:
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} &amp; = \frac{ad + b c}{b d};</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} &amp; = \frac{ac}{b d}.</mrow>
			</md>
		It seems reasonable to define the operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m> in a similar manner.  If we denote the equivalence class of <m>(a, b) \in S</m> by <m>[a, b]</m>, then we are led to define the operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m> by
			<me>[a, b] + [c, d] = [ad + b c,b d]</me>
		and
			<me>[a, b] \cdot [c, d] = [ac, b d],</me>
		respectively.  The next lemma demonstrates that these operations are independent of the choice of representatives from each equivalence class.</p>

		<lemma>
			<statement>
				<p>The operations of addition and multiplication on <m>F_D</m> are well-defined.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We will prove that the operation of addition is well-defined.  The proof that multiplication is well-defined is left as an exercise. Let <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m> and <m>[c_1, d_1] =[ c_2, d_2]</m>.  We must show that
					<me>[a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1,b_1 d_1] = [a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2,b_2 d_2]</me>
				or, equivalently, that
					<me>(a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1)( b_2 d_2) = (b_1 d_1) (a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2).</me>
				Since  <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m> and <m>[c_1, d_1] =[ c_2, d_2]</m>, we know that <m>a_1 b_2 = b_1 a_2</m> and <m>c_1 d_2 = d_1 c_2</m>.  Therefore,
					<md>
						<mrow>(a_1 d_1 + b_1 c_1)( b_2 d_2)  &amp; =  a_1 d_1 b_2 d_2 + b_1 c_1 b_2 d_2</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = a_1 b_2 d_1 d_2 + b_1 b_2 c_1 d_2</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = b_1 a_2 d_1 d_2 + b_1 b_2 d_1 c_2</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; =  (b_1 d_1) (a_2 d_2 + b_2 c_2).</mrow>
					</md></p>
			</proof>
		</lemma>

		<lemma xml:id="lemma-field-of-fractions">
			<statement>
				<p>The set of equivalence classes of <m>S</m>, <m>F_D</m>, under the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m>, together with the operations of addition and  multiplication defined by
					<md>
						<mrow>[a, b] + [c, d] &amp; = [ad + b c, b d]</mrow>
						<mrow>[ a, b] \cdot [c, d] &amp; = [ac, b d],</mrow>
					</md>
				is a field.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>The additive and multiplicative identities are <m>[0,1]</m> and <m>[1,1]</m>, respectively. To show that <m>[0,1]</m> is the additive identity, observe that
					<me>[a, b] + [0, 1] =  [ a 1 + b 0, b 1] = [a,b].</me>
				It is easy to show that <m>[1, 1]</m> is the multiplicative identity. Let <m>[a, b] \in F_D</m> such that <m>a \neq 0</m>. Then <m>[b, a]</m> is also in <m>F_D</m> and <m>[a,b] \cdot [b, a] = [1,1]</m>; hence, <m>[b, a]</m> is the multiplicative inverse for <m>[a, b]</m>.  Similarly, <m>[-a,b]</m> is the additive inverse of <m>[a, b]</m>.  We leave as exercises the verification of the associative and  commutative properties of multiplication in <m>F_D</m>. We also leave it to the reader to show that <m>F_D</m> is an abelian group under addition.</p>
 
				<p>It remains to show that the distributive property holds in <m>F_D</m>; however, 
					<md>
						<mrow>[a, b] [e, f] + [c, d][ e, f ] &amp; = [a e, b f ] + [c e, d f]</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = [a e d f + b f c e, b d f^2 ]</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = [a e d + b c e, b d f ]</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = [a d e + b c e, b d f ]</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = ( [a, b]  + [c, d] ) [ e, f ] </mrow>
					</md>
				and the lemma is proved.</p>
			</proof>
		</lemma>
 
		<p>The field <m>F_D</m> in Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-field-of-fractions" /> is called the <term>field of fractions</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>of fractions</sub></index> or <term>field of quotients</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>of quotients</sub></index> of the integral domain <m>D</m>.</p> 

		<theorem xml:id="theorem-field-of-quotients">
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>D</m> be an integral domain.  Then <m>D</m> can be embedded in a field of fractions <m>F_D</m>, where any element in <m>F_D</m> can be expressed as the quotient of two elements in <m>D</m>.  Furthermore, the field of fractions <m>F_D</m> is unique in the sense that if <m>E</m> is any field containing <m>D</m>, then there exists a map <m>\psi : F_D \rightarrow E</m> giving an isomorphism with a subfield of <m>E</m> such that <m>\psi(a) = a</m> for all elements <m>a \in D</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We will first demonstrate that <m>D</m> can be embedded in the field  <m>F_D</m>.  Define a map <m>\phi : D \rightarrow F_D</m> by <m>\phi(a)  = [a, 1]</m>.  Then for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>D</m>,
					<me>\phi( a + b ) = [a+b, 1] = [a, 1] + [b, 1] = \phi(a ) + \phi(b)</me>
				and
					<me>\phi( a b ) = [a b, 1] = [a, 1]  [b, 1] = \phi(a ) \phi(b);</me>
				hence, <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism.  To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one, suppose that <m>\phi(a) = \phi( b)</m>.  Then <m>[a, 1] = [b, 1]</m>, or <m>a = a1 = 1b = b</m>. Finally, any element of <m>F_D</m> can be expressed as the quotient of two elements in <m>D</m>, since   
					<me>\phi(a) [\phi(b)]^{-1} = [a, 1] [b, 1]^{-1} = [a, 1] \cdot [1, b] = [a, b].</me></p>

				<p>Now let <m>E</m> be a field containing <m>D</m> and define a map <m>\psi :F_D \rightarrow E</m> by <m>\psi([a, b]) = a b^{-1}</m>.  To show that <m>\psi</m> is well-defined, let <m>[a_1, b_1] = [a_2, b_2]</m>. Then <m>a_1 b_2 = b_1 a_2</m>. Therefore, <m>a_1 b_1^{-1} = a_2 b_2^{-1}</m> and <m>\psi( [a_1, b_1]) = \psi( [a_2, b_2])</m>.</p>

				<p>If <m>[a, b ]</m> and <m>[c, d]</m> are in <m>F_D</m>, then
					<md
						><mrow>\psi( [a, b] + [c, d] )  &amp; = \psi( [ad + b c, b d ] )</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; =  (ad +b c)(b d)^{-1}</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = a b^{-1} + c d^{-1}</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = \psi( [a, b] ) + \psi( [c, d] )</mrow>
					</md>
				and
				<md>
					<mrow>\psi( [a, b] \cdot [c, d] ) &amp; = \psi( [ac, b d ] )</mrow>
 					<mrow>&amp; =  (ac)(b d)^{-1}</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp; = a b^{-1}  c d^{-1}</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp; = \psi( [a, b] )  \psi( [c, d] ).</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, <m>\psi</m> is a homomorphism.</p>
 
				<p>To complete the proof of the theorem, we need to show that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one. Suppose that <m>\psi( [a, b] ) = ab^{-1} = 0</m>. Then <m>a = 0b = 0</m> and <m>[a, b] = [0, b]</m>.  Therefore, the kernel of <m>\psi</m> is the zero element <m>[ 0, b]</m> in <m>F_D</m>, and <m>\psi</m> is injective.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-domains-rational-polys">
			<p>Since <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is a field, <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is an integral domain.
