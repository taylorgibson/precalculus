  <title>Exponential Functions</title>
  <p>In Chapter 2 we graphed the toolkit function <m>f(x)=2^x</m> and in the previous section we introduced the function  <m>f(x)=e^x</m>.  Both of these functions are examples of exponential functions of the form  <m>f(x)=b^x</m>, where  <m>b \gt 0</m> and <m>b \neq 1</m>.  The positive real number <m>b</m> is called the <em>base</em> of the exponential function.</p>
  <p>We observe that the graph of <m>f(x)=2^x</m>  contains the points <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(1,2)</m> and that the graph of <m>f(x)=e^x</m> contains the points <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(1,e)</m>.  We know that for any positive base <m>b</m>, <m>b^0=1</m>, so graph of <m>f(x)=b^x</m> always contains the point <m>(0,1)</m>. Likewise, since <m>b^1=b</m> and <m>b^(-1)=\frac{1}{b}</m>, we know that these graphs will also contain the points <m>(1,b)</m> and <m>(-1,\frac{1}{b})</m>. In addition, all of the graphs will have the <m>x</m>-axis as an asymptote.  When the base is greater than <m>1</m> this asymptote is the negative part of the <m>x</m>-axis. Figure 6.1 shows a graph of <m>f(x)=e^x</m>, along with the toolkit function <m>g(x)=2^x</m> on the axes on the left. The graph on the right illustrates <m>y=3^x</m>, <m>y=4^x</m>, and <m>y=10^x</m>.</p>

          Recall from Chapter 2 that the graph of <m>h(-x)</m> is the reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis of the graph of <m>h(x)</m>. Thus the graph of the function <m>f(x)=3^{-x}</m> is the reflection of the graph of <m>y=3^x</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis.  The graph of <m>f(x)=3^{-x}</m> is shown in <xref ref="figure-hreflection-of-3x" text="type-local" />; it is decreasing, contains the points <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(-1,3)</m> and approaches the asumptote <m>y=0</m> as <m>x</m> approaches infinity.

          <xref ref="figure-graphofonethirdtothex" text="type-local" /> shows the graph of <m>g(x)=(\frac{1}{3})^x</m>. This is an exponential function with base <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.  The graph contains the points <m>(0,1)</m>  and <m>(1,1/3)</m> .  Because the base is less than <m>1</m>, the graph is decreasing. To understand why <m>f(x)=g(x)</m> for all <m>x</m>, note that the rules of exponents tell us that  <m>(\frac{1}{3})^x = ( 3^{-1} )^x = 3^{-1 \cdot x} = 3^{-x}</m>. Exponential functions like <m>g(x)=(\frac{1}{3})^x</m>, with a base between zero and one, and functions like <m>f(x)=3^{-x}</m>, with a base greater than one and a negative coefficient in the exponent, are both used to model <em>exponential decay</em>.

      <p>Use ideas you know about transformations to help you graph the functions  <m>g(x) = 4 \cdot 2^x</m> and <m>k(x)=2^{x+2}</m>. Why do these graphs look the way they do?

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <statement>
        <p>The graph of <m>g(x) = 4 \cdot 2^x</m> is a vertical stretch by a factor of <m>4</m> of the function <m>y=2^x</m>. The graph is shown on the left in Figure XX. The point <m>(0,1)</m> stretches up to <m>(0,4)</m> and the point <m>(1,2)</m> streatches up to <m>(1,8)</m>. The graph of <m>k(x)=2^{x+2}</m> is a horizontal shift <m>2</m> units to the left of the function <m>y=2^x</m>. The point <m>(0,1)</m> moves left to <m>(-2,1)</m>  and the point <m>(1,2)</m>  moves left to <m>(-1,2)</m>. You should notice that the graphs of <m>g(x)</m> and <m>k(x)</m> look identical; this is because <m>4 \cdot 2^x = 2^2 \cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}</m>.

    <title>Growth of a Tumor</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In a laboratory experiment, the growth of a tumor in a mouse was monitored over time.  Using data analysis techniques, the function <m>s = 0.32e^{0.11d}</m> was found to be a good model for the growth.  In this equation, <m>d</m> represents the number of days since monitoring began, and <m>s</m> represents the size of the tumor in cubic centimeters. Graph the function over an appropriate domain.  What is the initial size of the tumor? Determine the size after ten days and after twenty days.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <statement>
        <p>The graph of  <m>s=e^d</m> must be compressed vertically by a factor of <m>0.32</m> and stretched horizontally by a factor of <m>\frac{1}{0.11} \approx 9</m> to obtain the graph shown in <xref ref="figure-tumor-graph" text="type-local" />  The graph contains the point <m>(0,0.32)</m> since <m>(0,1)</m> has been stretched horizontally by a factor of <m>9</m> and stretched vertically by a factor of <m>0.32</m>.  We can estimate that another point has approximate coordinates <m>(9,0.32e) \approx (9,0.87)</m> since <m>(1,e)</m> has been stretched horizontally by a factor of <m>9</m> and stretched vertically by a factor of <m>0.32</m> Based on the context, the appropriate domain is non-negative values of <m>d</m>. Although we would expect there to be physical limitations on the size of the tumor, we do not know what this upper limit is, so we have not attempted to show this in the graph.

    <title>Cooling Coffee</title>
    <statement>
      <p>When a cup of hot coffee is placed in a cool room, the coffee begins to cool and will continue to do so until it reaches room temperature.  If the initial temperature of the coffee is <m>85^o C</m>  and the room temperature is <m>24^o C</m>, find an exponential function that models the temperature at any time <m>t</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <statement>
        <p>The cooling process can be reasonably well-modeled using exponential decay.  We can use the function <m>y=e^{-x}</m> to model exponential decay, but we must transform the curve so that it has a horizontal asymptote at <m>24</m>, not <m>0</m>, and has a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>85</m>, not <m>1</m>.  The graph of <m>y=e^{-x} + 24</m> will be be shifted up <m>24</m> units and will have an asymptote at <m>y=24</m> instead of <m>y=0</m>.. The graph of <m>y=e^{-x}+24</m> contains the point <m>(0,25)</m>; the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>1</m> unit above the horizontal asymptote. The function that models the coffee's temperature must have a <m>y</m>-intercept that is <m>85-24=61</m> units above the asymptote. This means that we must vertically stretch the graph by a factor of <m>61</m> before shifting the entire graph up <m>24</m>.  This can be done by multiplying the <m>e^{-x}</m> by <m>61</m>. The graph of the function <m>y = 61e^{-x} + 24</m> is shown in <xref ref="figure-cooling-coffee" text="type-local" /> </p>

        <p>Objects cool at different rates, depending on their composition and shape. In graphing the function in Figure XX we did not take into account how quickly the coffee cooled to room temperature. We can see from the graph that it seemed to cool very quickly, nearly reaching room temperature in <m>4</m> minutes, which is unrealistically fast.  In real life, coffee takes much longer to cool.  To model this slower cooling process, we need to apply a horizontal stretch to the functional model.  This would result in a model of the form <m>y=61e^{-kx}+24</m>, where <m>0 \lt k \lt 1</m>.  To find the particular value of <m>k</m> in a given situation requires us to know more than just the initial and room temperatures.

      <p>When you start to learn a new skill, such as typing, your proficiency begins rather low and grows toward some maximum level.  At first your proficiency grows quickly, but as you near the maximum level, your gains grow more slowly.  Exponential curves that display this behavior are called <em>learning curves</em>. Such functions can be modeled with transformed exponential functions. Consider the function <m>f(x) = 45 - 35e^{-0.3x}</m>, when <m>x</m> represents the number of weeks of practice and <m>f(x)</m> represents typing speed in words per minute.  Sketch a graph of this function and use the graph to describe the specific characteristics of this learning curve.

It is also important to note that <m>g(x)</m>  has <m>y=0</m> as a horizontal asymptote. As <m>x</m>-values increase or decrease without bound, <m>g(x)=\frac{1}{x-1}</m> approaches zero; so <m>f(x)=e^{\frac{1}{x-1}}</m> approaches <m>e^0</m>, or <m>1</m>.  This produces a horizontal asymptote in the composition at <m>y=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>Now consider the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> close to <m>x=1</m>.  As <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m> from the left, <m>\frac{1}{x-1}</m> decreases without bound, and the value of <m>f(x)=e^{\frac{1}{x-1}}</m> approaches <m>0</m> from above. The open circle on the graph of the composition is used to signify this. As <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m> from the right, <m>\frac{1}{x-1}</m> increases without bound, and the value of <m>f(x)=e^{\frac{1}{x-1}}</m> also increases without bound.  The graph of the composition <m>f(x)=e^{\frac{1}{x-1}}</m> is shown in <xref ref="figure-exp-recip" text="type-local" /></p>

        <p>Using the limit notation introduced in the previous section, we can write <me>\lim_{x \to \infty} b^x = 0</me>  provided <m>b \gt 1</m>. This is read "the limit of <m>b</m> raised to the <m>x</m> power, as <m>x</m> approached negative infinity, is <m>0</m>".

        <p>In a classroom experiment students made fudge the old-fashioned way.  They cooked sugar, milk, and chocolate until it reached <m>234^\circ</m> Fahrenheit.

      <statement>
        <p>Newton's law of cooling states that the change in temperature of an object as it cools is proportional to the difference between the current temperature and the ambient temperature.  Suppose the initial temperature of a cup of hot coffee was <m>92^\circ</m>C and the ambient temperature was <m>3^\circ</m>C.  The temperature of this coffee could be modeled with the following iterative system:
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>T_0 = 92,  T_n = T_{n-1} - k \left( T_{n-1} - 3 \right)</mrow>

        <p>In this situation, <m>n</m> represents the number of minutes that have elapsed</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Using the initial temperature of <m>92^\circ</m>C and a value of <m>k = 0.02</m>, use your calculator to generate values of the temperature over time and to produce a graph of these values.  Explain the shape of the graph in terms of the iterative equation.</li>
          <li>There are several steps involved in constructing a closed form equation to model this situation.  Start with the decreasing exponential function <m>f(x) = e^{-x}</m>.  Sketch a graph of this function.  What is the range of this function?  Where are its <m>y</m>-intercept and asymptote?</li>

      <statement>
        <p>Suppose, because of limitations in food and living space, a population of field mice experiences constrained growth. This means that the population cannot increase beyond a certain maximum number <m>M</m>.  The change in population is directly proportional to the product of the current population and the difference between the maximum population <m>M</m> and the current population.  This can be expressed by the following recursive equation:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Assume that the initial population is <m>100</m>, the maximum population is <m>1,000</m>, and <m>k = 0.0006</m>.  Use your calculator to generate values of the population over time and to produce a graph of these values.  Explain, in terms of the recursive equation, why the graph is shaped the way it is.</li>
          <li>We can use the graph from part (a) to help determine an explicit function to model this logistic growth.  Begin with the function <m>f(x) = 1 + e^{-x}</m>.  Sketch a graph of this function.  What is the range of this function?  What is the <m>y</m>-intercept?  </li>
          <li>Now graph <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}</m>.  What is the range of this function?  What is the <m>y</m>-intercept?  </li>
          <li>Apply transformations to <m>f</m> so that it has a <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>100</m> and grows less quickly.  The horizontal asymptote should be <m>y = 1000</m> .  This transformed function should produce a graph similar to the one you generated in part (a). This means that you have written an explicit function that models the logistic growth described at the beginning of the problem</li>

      <statement>
        <p>	The cane toad, a native of South America, was introduced to Australia in <m>1935</m> as a way to control the destructive sugar cane beetle.  It has no natural predators in Australia and it reproduces very rapidly.  In June <m>1935</m>, <m>102</m> cane toads were brought to Australia.  Twenty-one months later, the population of cane toads had grown to about <m>65,000</m>.</p>
        <p>Let <m>t</m> reprsent the number of years since June 1935, <m>m</m> reprsent the number of months since June 1935, and <m>C</m> represent the number of cane toads present.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write an explicit function, <m>C_1(m)</m> , that expresses the toad population in terms of <m>m</m>. To do this, you will need to find the monthly percentage rate at which the toad population grew.</li>
          <li>Modify the function you wrote in (a) to obtain a function,  <m>C_2(t)</m>, that expresses the toad population in terms of <m>t</m>. Note that the population when <m>m = 12</m> is the same as the population when <m>t = 1</m>.  Use properties of exponentials to write your function in the form <m>C_2(t)=a \cdot b^t</m>, for some constants <m>a, b</m>.  Interpret the information given by the base, <m>b</m></li>
          <li>Use either  <m>C_1(m)</m>  or <m>C_2(t)</m> to determine how long it takes the cane toad population to double.  Using this information, write a function <m>C_3(t)</m> that uses <m>2</m> as a base to express population as a function of <m>t</m>.</li>
          <li>Use each of your three models to predict how many cane toads there would have been <m>5</m> years after the landing of those initial <m>102</m> toads, if the growth had continued un-checked.  Of course, you should get approximately the same answer from all the models.  If they are not exactly the same, explain why this is the case.</li>
          <li>Pretend you are an Australian reporter who got interested in the cane toad situation just a year after they landed, and, being a mathematician too, you investigated the situation by developing the models above.  Write a short "newspaper" article in which you use some of that information to tell your readers about this situation.  Use your <m>5</m>-year prediction as the clincher, by relating that number to some geographical or other fact about Australia, to make it "real".  For example, you could compare that number of cane toads there will be to the population of Australia that year, or find some other measure of "cane toad density".  Be creative!  Cite the reference from which you get your Australian information.</li>
