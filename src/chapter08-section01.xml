 <title>Solving Trigonometric Equations</title>
  <introduction></introduction>
   <p>Applications of trigonometry frequently involve modeling a situation with a trigonometric function.  After the model is determined, questions about the situation can be answered by solving an equation based on the model.  The examples in this section will illustrate several techniques for solving trigonometric equations.</p>

  </subsection>

  <example>
   <statement>
    <p>Solve <m>\cos x=0.3</m>.</p>
   </statement>

   <solution>
    <p>The solutions of this equation are numbers whose cosine is 0.3. If you think of this problem in terms of the unit circle, solutions are arc lengths that terminate at points whose <m>x-</m>coordinate is 0.3. You can also think of this problem in terms of the cosine curve, where solutions are the <m>x-</m>coordinates of points of intersection of <m>y=\cos x</m> and <m>y=-0.3</m> <xref ref="cosine-image" text="type-local" />.  Either way you visualize this problem, it should be clear that there are infinitely many numbers whose cosine is 0.3. If <m>x=a</m>is one solution, then by the symmetry of the circle or symmetry of the graph <m>f\left(x \right)=\cos x</m>, <m>x=-a</m> is  another solution.</p>

    <figure xml:id="cosine-image">
     <caption>Solutions of <m>\cos x=0.3</m></caption>
     <image source="./images/cosine-image.jpg" width="50%"></image>
    </figure>

    <p>One solution of <m>\cos x=0.3</m> can be found using your calculator in radian mode: evaluating <m>\cos^{-1} 0.3</m> gives approximately <m>1.2661</m>. Using the symmetry of either the graph of the cosine function or the unit circle, <m>-1.2661</m> is another number whose cosine is 0.3. Because of the periodicity of the cosine function, adding multiples of <m>2\pi</m> to <m>\pm 1.2661</m> will yield more solutions. The complete set of solutions is <m>x=\pm 1.2661+2k\pi</m>, where <m>k</m> is any integer.  One of these solutions, <m>x=1.2661</m>, is also the radian measure of an angle in a right triangle. This is the angle for which the ratio <m>\frac{\text{length of adjecent leg}}{\text{length of hypotenuse}}</m> is equal to 0.3.</p>

    <p>Once we know that <m>\cos^{-1} 0.3=1.2661</m> from the calculator, there is another method to find the second value that produces a cosine value of 0.3. Studying the graph of <m>y=\cos x</m> or the unit circle we see there are two values in the interval <m>\left[0,2\pi \right]</m> that produce a cosine value of 0.3. There is one value at <m>x=1.2661</m> and another at <m>x=2\pi-1.2661=5.0171</m>. The value at <m>x=2\pi-1.2661</m> produces the same set of numbers as <m>-1.2661</m> when multiples of <m>2\pi</m> are added to <m>-1.2661</m>.  That is, if we let <m>k=1</m> in <m>-1.2661+2k\pi</m> we obtain <m>5.0171</m>.</p>

    <p>Suppose the equation in Example 1 is modified to be <m>\cos \left(\frac{5x-1}{3} \right)=0.3</m>. The technique for solving this equation is similar to the technique used for <m>\cos x=0.3</m>. However, in the new equation the argument of cosine is <m>\frac{5x-1}{3}</m> instead of <m>x</m>. Therefore, instead of having solutions <m>x=\pm 1.2661+2k\pi</m>, the new equation has solutions <m>\frac{5x-1}{3}=\pm 1.2661+2k\pi</m>, where <m>k</m> is any integer. The equation <m>\frac{5x-1}{3}=\pm 1.2661+2k\pi</m> must be solved for <m>x</m>.</p>

     <mrow>5x-1 \amp =3\left(\pm 1.2661+2k\pi \right)</mrow>
     <mrow>5x \amp =1+3\left(\pm 1.2661+2k\pi \right)</mrow>
     <mrow>x \amp =\frac{1+3\left(\pm 1.2661+2k\pi \right)}{5}</mrow>

    </md>

    <me>x=0.9597+\frac{6k\pi}{5} \text{ or } x=-0.5597+\frac{6k\pi}{5}.</me>

    <p>Notice that the modified equation, <m>\cos \left(\frac{5x-1}{3} \right)=0.3</m>, has a period of <m>\frac{6\pi}{5}</m> which corresponds to the <m>\frac{6\pi}{5}</m> added to each of the solutions to the equation.</p>
  </solution>

   <title>Class Practice</title>
    <p>Use the results of Example 1 to help you solve <m>\cos \left(\frac{1}{2}x-6 \right)=0.3</m>. How are the solutions of the equations similar to each other? How are they different?</p>
 </subsection>

 <example>
  <statement>
   <p>Find all solutions of <m>\sin \left(2x \right)=-0.5</m> between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>.</p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
   <p>Solutions of <m>\sin \left(2x \right)=-0.5</m> correspond to points where <m>y=\sin \left(2x \right)</m> intersects <m>y=-0.5</m>. The graph in <xref ref="sine-image" text="type-local" /> shows that there are two intersections in each cycle of the sine curve. The period of <m>y=\sin \left(2x \right)</m> is <m>\pi</m>, so one cycle is completed every <m>\pi</m> units. This means there are four solutions to the equation between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>. </p>

   <figure xml:id="sine-image">
    <caption>Graph of <m>y=\sin \left(2x \right)</m> and <m>y=-0.5</m></caption>
    <image source="./images/sine-image.jpg" width="50%"></image>
   </figure>

   <p>With your calculator in radian mode, you should find that <m>-0.5236</m> is a number whose sine is <m>-0.5</m>.  By the symmetry of the unit circle, <m>\pi -\left(-0.5236 \right)</m> is another number whose sine is <m>-0.5</m>. Therefore, where <m>k</m> is an integer,
    <md>
     <mrow>2x \amp =-0.5236+2k\pi \text{ or } 3.6652+2k\pi</mrow>
     <mrow>x \amp =-0.2618+2k\pi \text{ or } 1.8326+2k\pi</mrow>
    </md>
   </p>

   <p>Since we want only solutions between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>, the solutions can be obtained by substituting integer values of <m>k</m> that produce <m>x-</m>values between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>. The <m>x-</m>values 1.8326, 2.8798, 4.9742, and 6.0214 are all solutions of <m>\sin \left(2x \right)=-0.5</m> between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>. Verify that all four of these numbers do indeed satisfy the original equation.</p>

   <p>As an alternative method of obtaining a solution, you may recognize that <m>-0.5</m> is one of the special values of the sine function that can be determined without a calculator: <m>\sin \left(\frac{7\pi}{6} \right)=-\frac{1}{2}</m>. This means that <m>\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> is one possible value for <m>2x</m>. By the symmetry of the unit circle another value for <m>2x</m> is <m>\frac{11\pi}{6}</m>.  Thus, <m>2x=\frac{7\pi}{6}</m> or <m>\frac{11\pi}{6}</m>, so <m>x=\frac{7\pi}{12}</m> or <m>\frac{11\pi}{12}</m>. Other solutions can be obtained  by adding or subtracting <m>\pi</m> (the period of  <m>\sin \left(2z \right)</m>) to these two solutions, resulting in <m>\frac{7\pi}{12}</m>, <m>\frac{11\pi}{12}</m>, <m>\frac{19\pi}{12}</m>, and <m>\frac{23\pi}{12}</m>. This technique leads to exact solutions to the equation <m>\sin \left(2x \right)=-0.5</m>. Notice that exact solutions are possible only because <m>-0.5</m> is a special value of the sine function.</p>
  </solution>
 </example>

 <example>
  <statement>
   <p>Solve <m>\sin x >0.8</m>.</p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
   <p>Solutions of this inequality are numbers whose sine is greater than 0.8.  Solutions correspond to <m>x-</m>values on the sine curve whose <m>y-</m>coordinate is greater than 0.8 <xref ref="sine-image1" text="type-local" />.  Because the sine curve oscillates, it is useful to find where <m>\sin x</m> is equal to 0.8 and then study the graph to see where <m>\sin x</m> is greater than 0.8.  Using a calculator in radian mode to solve <m>\sin x=0.8</m> gives <m>x=\sin^{-1} \left(0.8 \right)=0.9273</m>. By symmetry another solution is <m>x=\pi -0.9273=2.2143</m>. Therefore, the solution set of <m>\sin x=0.8</m> is <m>x=0.9273+2k\pi</m> where <m>k</m> is any integer. These values are marked on the graphs in <xref ref="cosine-image" text="type-local" />.  Note that <m>\sin x > 0.8</m> for <m>x-</m>values between 0.9273 and 2.2143. Because of periodicity, intervals containing solutions of the inequality are repeated every <m>2\pi</m> units. Therefore, the complete solution set of <m>\sin x > 0.8</m> is <m>0.9273+2k\pi \lt x \lt 2.2143+2k\pi</m> where <m>k</m> is any integer.</p>

  <statement>
  <p>The graph in <xref ref="hourhand-image" text="type-local" /> shows how the distance between the ceiling and the tip of the hour hand on a clock changes over time. At what times is this distance less than 30 cm?</p>

  <figure xml:id="hourhand-image">
   <caption>Distance from Ceiling versus Time since 6 oâ€™clock</caption>
   <image source="./images/hourhand-image.jpg" width="50%"></image>
  </figure>

  </statement>

  <solution>
   <p>We first need to write an equation for the graph in <xref ref="hourhand-image" text="type-local" />.  We investigated this question in section 1 of this chapter.  The period is 12, the amplitude is 15, and the graph starts at a maximum and has been shifted up 38 units.  Let <m>t</m> represent the hours since 6 oâ€™clock.   An equation for the graph is <me>d=15\cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)+38.</me> To determine when the distance is less than 30 cm we need to solve the inequality <me>15\cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)+38 \lt 30</me>.</p>

   <p>Because the graph oscillates, it is useful to first find where <m>15\cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)+38</m> is equal to 30.  Subtracting 38 from both sides and then dividing by 15 yields <men xml:id="cosine-equation"> \cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)=-\frac{8}{15}.</men></p>

   <p>Solutions of the equation <xref ref="cosine-equation" text="type-local" /> are given by <me>\frac{\pi t}{6}=\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{8}{15} \right)=2.1333 \text{ or } \frac{\pi t}{6}=2\pi -\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{8}{15} \right)=4.1499.</me> Since <m>\cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)=-\frac{8}{15}</m> has infinitely many solutions, we must write <me>\frac{\pi t}{6}=2.1333+2k\pi \text{ or } \frac{\pi t}{6}=4.1499+2k\pi.</me> Solving for <m>t</m> gives <m>t=4.0744+12k</m> or <m>t=7.9256+12k</m>.</p>

   <p>These are <m>t-</m>values at which the distance is equal to 30 cm.  The graph in <xref ref="cosine-image1" text="type-local" /> shows that the distance is less than 30 cm when t is between 4.0744 and 7.9256.  Since <m>t</m> represents the number of hours that have elapsed since 6 oâ€™clock, <m>t=4.0744</m> corresponds to about 10:04 and <m>t=7.9256</m> corresponds to about 1:56. This means that the distance between the ceiling and the tip of the hour hand is less than 30 cm between the times of about 10:04 and 1:56.</p>

    <caption>Solutions of <m>15\cos \left(\frac{\pi t}{6} \right)+38 \lt 30</m></caption>

   </figure>

  </solution>

 </example>

 <p>We can solve equations of the form  using methods described in examples 1, 2, and 4.  We can combine this new knowledge with algebra and previously learned techniques to solve a variety of other equations forms.  Some examples of these equations are:
 <me>\left( \sin x-1\right)\left(\cos x+\frac{1}{2} \right)=0</me>
 <me>\cos^2 x-4\cos x=0</me>
 <me>10^{\sin x}=5</me>
 <me>\frac{\cos \left(4x \right)}{\sin \left(3x \right)} \gt 0</me>
 Using knowledge of solving quadratic equations leads us to be able to find the values of <m>x</m> that solve <m>\tan^2 x+\tan x-1=0</m>. The quadratic equation is not easily factorable; but with the substitution of <m>a=\tan x</m>, the equation can be written as <me>a^2+a-1=0.</me> Using the quadratic formula we find <m>a=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2}</m>. Therefore, <m>\tan x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt 5}{2}</m> or <m>\tan x = \frac{-1 - \sqrt 5}{2}</m> which will lead to an infinite number of solutions for <m>x</m>.</p>

 <p>However, there are some equations that cannot be solved using these techniques; for example, the equation <m>x=\cos x</m>. For an equation of this type, we must rely on graphs to find points for which <m>x=\cos x</m>.</p>
