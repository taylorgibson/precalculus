  <title>Scientific Scales</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Scientists commonly use logarithms to create a simple scale for data; this is beneficial when some values in the data set are many times larger than other values in the data set. For example, the pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, measured in moles per liter. Solutions with a high concentration of hydrogen ions are acidic, while solutions with a low concentration are basic. The concentration of hydrogen ions in household ammonia is approximately <m>0.0000000000005</m> moles/liter, while the concentration of hydrogen ions in lemon juice is ten billion times larger at approximately <m>0.005</m> moles/liter.</p>

    <p>To describe these vastly different values on the same scale, logarithms are used. The pH of a solution is defined to be
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{pH} = -\log \left( H^{+} \right), \text{ where } H^{+} \text{ is the concentration of hydrogen ions.}</mrow>
      </md>
      So we say that household ammonia has a pH of <m>- \log(0.0000000000005) = 12.3</m>, while lemon juice has a pH of <m>- \log(0.005) = 2.3</m>. The pH of pure water is about <m>7</m>. Solutions with a pH less than <m>7</m> are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than <m>7</m> are basic. By using logarithms, chemists take values that vary by huge amounts and place them on a simple scale that ranges from about <m>0</m> to <m>14</m>, which is much easier to understand.

    <title>The Decibel Scale for Sound</title>
    <p>The intensity of a sound is dependent on the actual energy carried in the sound wave and is measured in units of power per unit area, or <m>\frac{ \text{watts} }{ \text{meter} ^2}</m>.  The greater the intensity, the louder the perceived sound. The intensities of some common sounds are given in <xref ref="decibel-table" text="type-local" />.  Physicists define a loudness level (measured in decibels) that is related to the actual intensity, <m>I</m> (measured in Watts / meter<m>^2</m>), of the sound by the following equation:
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{Loudness Level (dB) } = 10 \cdot \log \left( \frac{I  \text{ W} / \text{m}^2 } {10^{-12} \text{ W} / \text{m}^2 }  \right)</mrow>
    </md>
    The threshold of human hearing is a sound with intensity <m>10^{-12} \text{ W} / \text{m}^2</m>. It is defined to be of loudness level <m>0</m> dB and serves as a baseline by which other sounds are measured. You can use the equation above to verify that the loudness is <m>0</m> dB when the intensity is <m>10^{-12} \text{ W} / \text{m}^2</m>.

    <p>
      A sound of <m>10</m> decibels has ten times the intensity of a <m>0</m> decibel sound; a sound of <m>20</m> decibels has one hundred times the intensity of a <m>0</m> dB sound, or ten times the intensity of a <m>10</m> dB sound. Similarly, a sound of <m>30</m> dB has one thousand times the intensity of a <m>0</m> dB sound or ten times the intensity of a <m>20</m> dB sound.  When the loudness level increases by an increment of <m>10</m> decibels, the actual sound intensity is multiplied by a factor of ten.  Therefore, the intensity of a <m>60</m> dB sound (ordinary conversation) is not double the intensity of a <m>30</m> dB sound (a whisper).  Rather, the sound intensity of conversation is three factors of ten, or <m>1000</m>, times the intensity of a whisper, and the intensity of a whisper is <m>1000</m> times that of the least audible sound.  Equal differences in loudness level, measured in decibels, correspond to equal ratios of sound intensity.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Compare the decibel level of two sirens at a distance of <m>30</m> meters to the decibel level of a single siren at the same distance.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <statement>
          <p>The total intensity of two simultaneous sounds is the sum of the individual intensities of the two sounds.
            <md>
              <mdrow>\text{Loudness Level (2 sirens) } \amp = 10 \cdot \log\left( \frac{2 \cdot 10^{-2} }{10^{-12}} \right)</mdrow>
              <mdrow>\amp = 10 \cdot \log \left( 2 \cdot 10^{10} \right)</mdrow>
              <mdrow>\amp = 10 \cdot \left( \log(2) + 10 \right) \approx 103 \text{dB}</mdrow>
            </md>
            Note that the total decibel level is not the sum of the individual decibel levels.  When the intensity level doubles, the decibel level increases by <m>10\cdot\log2 \approx 3 \text{dB}</m>

    <exercise>
      <statement>

        <p>The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake in terms of the total energy released by the earthquake.  One form of Richter's equation is
          <md>
            <mrow>M = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \log(E) - 2.9</mrow>
          </md>
          where <m>M</m> is the magnitude and <m>E</m> is the energy in joules of the earthquake.
          <ol>
            <li>If an earthquake releases <m>10^{13}</m> joules of energy, what is the magnitude on the Richter scale?</li>
            <li>A very powerful earthquake occurred in Colombia on January 31, 1906, and measured <m>8.6</m> on the Richter scale.  Approximately how many joules of energy were released?</li>

    <!-- Exercise 4 -->
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>According to seismologists, an earthquake which registers <m>2</m> on the Richter scale is hardly perceptible while an earthquake which measures <m>5</m> on this scale is capable of shattering windows and dishes and is generally classified as "minor."  The San Francisco earthquake in <m>1989</m> caused great damage and registered <m>7.1</m> on the Richter scale.
        <ol>
          <li>Compare the energy release of the San Francisco earthquake to a level <m>5</m> minor earthquake.  That is, calculate the ratio of their released energies.</li>
          <li>If an earthquake releases ten times as much energy as the San Francisco earthquake, what would it measure on the Richter scale?</li>
          <li>If an earthquake releases twice as much energy as the San Francisco earthquake, what would it measure on the Richter scale?</li>

      <statement>
        <p>In the first edition of <em>Contemporary Precalculus Through Applications</em>, the authors erroneously stated that "each number on the Richter scale represents an earthquake ten times as strong as one of the next lower number".  Megan Bisk, a student at Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, Massachusetts, corrected us and proved that a <m>0.67</m> increase on the Richter scale represents an earthquake <m>10</m> times as strong.
        <ol>
          <li>Prove that Megan was correct.</li>
          <li>Show that the correct statement is: "each number on the Richter scale represents an earthquake approximately <m>32</m> times as strong as one of the next lower number".</li>

        <p>An empty auditorium has a sound level of <m>40</m> dB (due to heating and air-conditioning and outside noise).  On Saturday, <m>100</m> students are taking the SAT.  While they are working on the test, the only sounds are labored breathing and pencils rapidly moving across the paper.  The noise level then rises to <m>60</m> dB (not counting the groans).

    <!-- Exercise 8 -->
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>The basic astronomical unit of brightness is <em>magnitude</em>.  The perceived, or apparent, magnitudes of two stars (<m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>) are related to their actual intensities (<m>I_1</m> and <m>I_2</m>) by the equation
        <md>
          <mrow>m_1 - m_2 = 2.5 \cdot \log \left( \frac{I_2}{I_1} \right)</mrow>
        </md>

        If a bright star has intensity <m>I_1</m> and a dim star has intensity <m>I_2</m>, then <m>I_2 \lt I_1</m> and <m>0 \lt \frac{I_2}{I_1} \lt 1</m>. Since the logarithm of a number between zero and one is negative, the quantity <m>\left( m_2 - m_1 \right)</m> will be negative. Thus <m>m_1 \lt m_2</m>, and this implies that the magnitude of the first, brighter star is smaller. We see, 	then, that small magnitudes are associated with brighter, more intense light sources. In <m>1856</m>, Norman Pogson defined the magnitude scale such that the first magnitude, <m>m_1 = 1</m>, corresponds to the brightest-appearing stars and the sixth magnitude, <m>m_2 = 6</m>, corresponds to the faintest stars visible to the naked eye.</p>

        <p>So the intensity of a star of magnitude one is <m>100</m> times the intensity of a star with magnitude six. The magnitude system has been extended to negative magnitudes for bright objects like the sun and the moon and to positive magnitudes beyond <m>6</m> for stars visible only with a telescope.  <xref ref="star-chart" text="type-local" /> illustrates the magnitude scale.
