  <title>Error Bounds and the Accuracy of a Prediction</title>
  <p>
    Consider Hiro's interest in predicting the date on which the first cherry blossoms appear from SECTION XX. Using a larger set of data than the simple example used earlier, we can find the least squares line relating the average temperature in March and the number of days in April before the cherry blossoms appear is
    <md>
      <mrow>f(x) = -4.76x + 33.51</mrow>
    </md>

    If the average temperature in March this year was 3.5 <quantity><unit base="degreeCelsius"/></quantity>, Hiro expects the blossoms to appear on a date close to the 17th if he uses the least squares line as his model, since <m>f(3.5) = 16.85</m>. But, remember the models we create from data using regression capture the important features of the process being considered, but cannot give exact predictions. Taken literally, <m>16.85</m> would be at 8:24 pm on April 16. Clearly, we do not believe our model could possibly be this precise. In fact, given the obvious variability, at best we can say that we expect to see the blossoms appear somewhere <em>around</em> the 17th of April. Maybe within a day of April 17th if we're feeling confident, or within the week of April 17th if we feel less confident. Notice that there were four years in which the average temperature was <m>4</m> <quantity><unit base="degreeCelsius"/></quantity>, and the cherry blossoms appeared on the 14th, 21st, 13th, and 11th of April.  On average, around the 15th (<m>14.75</m>) and our model precicts <m>14.47</m>. The goal of the least-squares regression line is to estimate the <em>average</em> <m>y</m>-value for any given <m>x</m>-value. This goal acknowledges the inherent variability in all real-world processes.

  <p>
    The regression equation gives us the signal coming from the relationship between temperature and the date of blooming.  What about the noise?  We know that the value given by the regression equation is unlikely to be correct, the actual date is a result of signal plus the random variation about the signal ever-present in the world that we call the noise.  So we need an estimate of the size of the noise in the model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the residuals provide information about how the data varies from the model, we can use the residuals to determine a range of plausible values from the model. Looking at the residual plot in <xref ref="full-cherry-blossom-data" text="type-loca" />, we see that all but two of the residuals have magnitude less than <m>4</m>. So it is quite likely that the blossoms this year will occur between April 13 and April 21, that is <m>17 \pm 4</m>. This interval is not guaranteed, but the information from previous years makes us feel fairly confident in an interval of <m>4</m> days in either direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The method we have just used to determine our interval estimate is quite subjective. As you might expect, statisticians have objective ways to produce intervals associated with predictions from linear models. You will learn some of these methods if you take a statistics course, but the mathematics behind the methods are beyond what we can do in this course. Nevertheless, we can create some approximate rough-and-easy bounds. One way would be to use the value of the residual with largest magnitude, like we did above when we added and subtracted <m>7</m> from the predicted value. Another method would be to use the average value of the residuals. This sounds good, but as noted earlier in SECTION XX(3?), the average residual value will always be zero, since the positive residuals balance out the negative ones. To avoid this cancellation, we could first take the absolute value of the residuals and then calculate the mean or median. If this reminds you of the discussion in SECTION XX(8?), it should!.  It is exactly the same discussion. We have a set of numbers, in this case the residuals, and we want one number to represent a typical value. The discussion ends just as it did earlier, with the least-squares criterion based on the distance formula being the choice of statisticians.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we noted when we first discussed the standard deviation in SECTION XX(8?), the majority of values in the data set will fall within <m>2</m> standard deviations of the mean, and almost all within <m>3</m> standard deviations from the mean regardless of the shape of the data.  The standard error of the estimate is a useful and simple measure of the degree of concentration of the observations around the regression line. The standard error of the estimate is most easily approximated by the standard deviation of the residuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a least squares line is fit to a linear data set, then more than <m>75\%</m> (most often much more than <m>75\%</m>) of all the residual values will fall within two standard deviations of the average of the residuals. Since the average of the residuals is always zero for the least squares line, most of the data will fall within <m>2</m> standard deviations of the residuals from the values predicted by our linear model. In this example the standard deviation of the residuals is <m>s = 2.91</m>. If we add and subtract <m>5.82</m> days from the predictions associated with this model, we should have a reliable estimate of when to expect the blossoms. The standard deviation of the residuals is easy to compute since this is a built-in feature of most calculators and computer software that help us analyze data. Statistical software can compute a more precise estimate using higher level mathematics, but our two standard deviation approximation works well and we will use it in the remainder of this course.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you choose a technique for calculating intervals to place on the estimates, you can produce error bounds for your model. <em>Error bounds</em> are models that predict the upper and lower bounds you expect your predictions to fall between. The model we developed for Hiros data is <m>f(x) = -4.76x + 33.51</m>. If we decide to determine an interval for our predictions by adding and subtracting twice the standard deviation, <m>5.82</m> days, we are fairly certain that the actual day the flowers will bloom falls between the two linear models <m>f(x) = \left( -4.76x + 33.51 \right) - 5.82</m> and <m>f(x) = \left( -4.76x + 33.51 \right) + 5.82</m>. These equations simplify to <m>f(x) = -4.76x + 27.69</m> and <m>f(x) =- 4.76x + 39.33</m>. These error bounds are shown with the least squares line and data in <xref ref="full-cherry-blossom-data-with-errorbounds" text="type-local" />. All except two data points are within these bounds, so they appear to do a good job of capturing the variation in the original data.

    By including error bounds in his model, Hiro gives additional information about the accuracy of predictions from the model. Using two times the standard deviation of the residuals, Hiro can use the average temperature in March to predict the date on which the first blossoms will appear to within approximately <m>6</m> days. His best guess is still the prediction from his least-squares line, which is the 17th of the month. But, he should be more certain in predicting that the first blossom will appear somewhere between the 11th and the 23rd of April. The way to interpret these error bounds is to say, we would not be surprised if the blossoms appear sometime between the 11th and 23rd. If someone were to tell us that the blossoms first appeared on the 25th of April, we would be surprised and ask, "Are you sure?  That is not what I expected." The error bounds give the interval in which we are not surprised.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Pearson's Father-Son data, the equation of the line is <m>\text{Son} = 34.428x + 0.5095 \text{Father}</m>. For a father that is <m>67</m> inches tall, our prediction would be that his first-born son would be about <m>68.3</m> inches tall. The standard deviation of the residuals is <m>s = 2.434</m> inches, so we would find it unsurprising to find a son whose father is <m>67</m> inches tall to be somewhere between <m>63.4</m> and <m>73.2</m> inches tall. Just where in this interval the son falls is due, naturally, to the characteristics of the mother, the level of nutrition through childhood, and many other variables not taken into account in our model.

    As a final example, in <xref ref="artic-sea-ice" text="type-local" />, the standard error of the estimate is used to indicate with shading the region within which the majority of the observations fall. The estimated volume of Arctic Sea Ice for the years 1979 – 2016 are shown below <fn>Source: Polar Science Center, Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington</fn> with one and two standard deviations of the residuals highlighted. The values shown in the graph are the differences in the estimated volume and the average over the time interval and the one and two standard deviation lines are shaded. Notice that almost all of the data (except for a few large deviations) fall within the two standard deviation region.

          As we will see in CHAPTER XX(5?), the error bands can be used with non-linear models as well.   Curves “parallel” to a function can be created by vertical shifts of the model up and down two standard deviations of the residuals. In the figure below, one and two standard deviations are shaded. Explain why the bands look wider in September than in June.
