  <title>Linear Models</title>
    <p>When you examined the scatterplots in the exercises in the last section, you should have noticed several graphs with points that stand apart from the others. In <xref ref="exercises-scatterplot-1" text="type-local" />, the point in the upper right corner represents an airplane with an exceptionally high number of seats and exceptionally high fuel consumption (Boing 747). Cover this points with your finger and use the other points to predict fuel consumption for a plane with 400 seats. Do you consider this point to follow the general trend of the other data points? In <xref ref="exercises-scatterplot-2" text="type-local" />, there is a point in the upper left corner that fits the general trend of the data but is noticeably removed from the other points. This point represents a year in which the average March temperature was unusually low and the cherry blossoms did not appear until late in April. These points differ from the outlier found in <xref ref="exercises-scatterplot-6" text="type-local" />. The outlier represents Michael Jordan, the legendary player who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA Championships. Jordan had the highest playing time but his playing time is not inconsistent with that of the other players. This point is an outlier because of the very high number of points scored. Michael Jordan does not have statistics that follow the general pattern of the other players on the Bulls.</p>
    <p>When a relationship is suggested by a scatterplot, we usually want to describe it mathematically by finding an equation that summarizes the way the two variables are related. Such an equation is another example of a mathematical model. When we discussed mathematical models at the beginning of the chapter, we pointed out that a good model simplifies the phenomenon it represents and gives us the ability to predict. If we can find the equation of a curve that closely “fits” a scatterplot, we can focus on the important characteristics of the relationship between the variables without the clutter of a scatterplot. We can also use this equation to predict the values of one variable for specific values of the other variable. Sometimes we use the model to \emph{interpolate}, or estimate new values among data values and sometimes we use the model to \emph{extrapolate}, or predict values outside the region of the data. To extrapolate, we must have good reason to believe that the pattern seen in the data continues.</p>
    <p>To obtain an equation to model the Leaning Tower of Pisa data during the period in which the tower was leaning, you could sketch a line that passes through the data and follows the general path of the data. What is the equation of the line that best fits this data? The process of fitting a linear model to a set of data is an important aspect of data analysis. With the help of graphing calculators or computers, we can quickly fit a line to a given set of data. For the moment we will just estimate the location of the linear model to demonstrate how you can use this line. In <xref ref="tower-of-pisa-linear-model" text="type-local" /> we show a line through the data of our scatterplot.</p>

    <p>Notice how the line follows the pattern of the points in this scatterplot. Some of the points are above the line, some are below, but they are all close to the line. Since the data points are closely following the path of our line, we can conclude that the relationship between these variables is strong and can feel very confident that our line does a good job of describing this particular phenomenon. We expect the same trend to continue into the near future, so we would also feel confident in using our model to extrapolate, or to predict the value of the lean in future years.</p>
    <p>How close do the points have to be to consider the model good? Think back to Example 1 and re-examine the scatterplot in <xref ref="scatterplot-tower-of-pisa" text="type-local" />. Try to sketch a line that follows the path of this data. <xref ref="tower-of-pisa-linear-model" text="type-local" /> shows one possible line that could be used to model from the data of Francis Galton, one of the founders of modern-day statistics. In the late 1800’s, Galton compared the height, in inches, of 952 fathers with the height at maturity of his firstborn son. It was this study and others like it that led Galton to develop the method of linear regression and to define the standard deviation as a measure of spread. You will notice that most of the data points are not close to the line. This does not mean that a linear model is inappropriate. There is no evidence at all of any curvature in the data, so a linear equation is indeed appropriate. There is a great deal of variation in the heights of the sons, and so our model needs to acknowledge this in some way. The issue of closeness is relative and depends on the particular variables and the size of their values.

        <statement>
        <p>In Iowa City, Iowa, the monthly utility bill provides the customer with information about the daily cost of gas and electricity as well as the average temperature during the month. The following information has been taken from a household in Iowa City for the months of August through September. (Source: Kathleen M.

          <p>Comment on the important characteristics of the scatterplots provided below. The legends describe the variables on each axis. Consider the shape (linear or curved), whether the data describes an increasing or decreasing (positive or negative) relationship, any gaps, clusters, or outliers apparent in the data. Write a sentence or two to explain the story the data telling about the relationship between the two variables.
