  			    <title>Recursive Functions</title>

  	         <p>In a previous chapter we learned that a function is a special sets of ordered pairs.  In most of the examples in the preceeding chapters, functions were described by an algebraic expression that could be evaluated for a particular input value resulting in a unique output value. Such algebraic expressions are called closed form or explicit expressions.  For these functions, the relationship <m>y=f(x)</m> is used to show how the <m>y</m>-value is related to the given <m>x</m>-value. For example, the function <m>f(x)=x^2+6x</m> is an explicit function. This notation tells us that any particular numerical value for <m>x</m> is paired with the <m>y</m>-value equal to <m>x^2+6x</m>. So 1 is paired with 7, since <m>f(1)=(1)^2+6(1)=7</m> , and <m>-3</m> is paired with <m>-9</m>, since <m>f(-3)=(-3)^2+6(-3)=-9</m>.</p>

             <p>In this section we will investigate functions that are defined recursively. The domain values for these functions are positive whole numbers, and each range value is defined in terms of the preceding range value, rather than in terms of an <m>x</m>-value.</p>

      			 <example xml:id="ibuprofen-example-one-dose">
      			      <title>Ibuprofen in the blood stream</title>
      			      <p>Joan has a headache and decides to take a 200mg ibuprofen tablet for pain relief.  The drug is absorbed into her system and stays in her system until the drug is metabolized and filtered out by the liver and kidneys.  Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized.  Every four hours, Joan's body removes <m>67\%</m> of the ibuprofen that was in her body at the beginning of that four-hour time period.  How much of the ibuprofen will remain in her system <m>24</m> hours after taking the <m>200</m>mg tablet?</p>
      				    <solution>
                    <p>One way to generate values for the amount of ibuprofen in Joan's system is to use an iterative process.  In any iterative process the current value of a variable is used to determine the next value.  In this example, we generate a new amount of ibuprofen by subtracting the amount of ibuprofen filtered out of Joan's system from the amount that was previously there.  Since Joan begins with 200mg of ibuprofen, we write
                    <md>
      						    <mrow>D_0=0</mrow>
      						  </md>
                    where <m>D_0</m> is used to represent the amount of ibuprofen present at the start of the process</p>
                    <p>We will use <m>D_1</m> to represent the amount of ibuprofen left after four hours.  The subscripts are used to count the steps, or iterations,  in the iterative process. In this problem the subscript  represents the number of four-hour time periods since Joan took the tablet.  In four hours, her kidneys have filtered out <m>67\%</m> of the drug from her bloodstream, so we write
                    <md>
                      <mrow>D_1=D_0-.67D_0=200-.67\cdot 200=66</mrow>
                    </md></p>
                    <p>The amount of drug in her body after a second four-hour time period is represented by <m>D_2</m>.
                    <md>
                      <mrow>D_2=D_1-0.67D_1=66-.067\cdot 66=21.78</mrow>
                    </md></p>
                    <p>Similarly, we know that successive values of the amount of drug in her body can be generated by
                    <md>
                      <mrow>D_3=D_2-0.67D_2=7.187</mrow>
                      <mrow>D_4=D_3-0.67D_3=2.372</mrow>
                    </md>
                    and, in general,
                    <md>
                      <mrow>D_n=D_{n-1}-0.67D_{n-1},n=1,2,3...</mrow>
                    </md></p>
                    <p>Using a spreadsheet or calculator, we can generate successive values of <m>D_n</m> as shown in <xref ref="figure-plot-ibuprofen-one-dose" />.  Note that values in the table are rounded to three decimal places but that exact values were used in all computations. The amount of drug in Joan's body drops to less than <m>1</m> mg between the fourth and fifth time periods.  If she takes a single <m>200</m> mg dose, Joan will have only about <m>0.258</m> mg remaining in her body <m>24</m> hours later.</p>

      			      <p>Joan strained her knee playing tennis and her doctor has prescribed ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and control pain.  Joan is instructed to take two 200-milligram ibuprofen tablets every 4 hours for three days.  Joan doesn’t like taking medicine, so she decides to take only one tablet every four hours for six days.  After the six days, Joan’s knee has not responded to the medication.

Every four hours she took another 200 mg tablet, and we can modify our recursive system to model this behavior. At the end of the nth four-hour period, Joan’s body has filtered <m>67\%</m> of the drug that was in her body after n-1st  four-hour period.  In addition, 200 mg from the new tablet have been added into her body.  The recursive system representing the amount of ibuprofen in Joan’s body if she takes one tablet every four hours is</p>

                   <p>The points shown in <xref ref="figure-plot-ibuprofen-multi-dose" /> represent the amount of the drug in Joan’s body immediately after she takes a tablet.  Between consecutrive doses, we know that the level of the drug declines.  We assume that the level “jumps up” at the moment she takes another tablet, and the recursive system enables us to compute these values.   If we  record the drug levels only after she takes a tablet, then we see that these values reach an equilibrium of approximately 298.51 mg.  To see why this equilibrium has been reached, consider how much of the 298.51 mg of the drug will be filtered in four hours.  Joan’s kidneys will filter out <m>67\%</m> of the 298.51 mg in her body, or approximately 200 mg, which will be replaced when she takes the next tablet. Equilibrium occurs because the amount of drug taken into the body is the same as the amount filtered prior to taking the next tablet.</p>

                   <p>Suppose the drug Joan is taking has a therapeutic level of 450 mg.  This means that there must be at least 450 milligrams of the drug in her body for Joan to receive the benefits of the drug.  No wonder she thought the drug was not working.  It wasn’t!</p>

               <p>Drugs generally have a therapeutic range rather than a single therapeutic level.  In other words, a drug is effective if the level in the body is between two values.  At concentrations below this range, too little of the drug is present to have a measurable effect, and concentrations above this range may be toxic.  The level of drug in the body peaks just after the drug is taken, while the drug level is at a minimum just before the dosage is taken.

       <title>Using Recursion to Understand Loans and Investments</title>

        <p>Recursive systems are useful for finding solutions to various types of problems.</p>
        <p>Suppose you are interested in purchasing a car and need a <m>\$10,000</m> loan. The lending agency is going to charge you interest each month and you are going to make a payment each month. You plan to pay <m>\$230</m> each month until the loan is paid off. Suppose the interest rate is <m>0.45\%</m> per month (approximately <m>5.4\%</m> per year). How long will it take you to repay the loan? What is the total amount you will have to repay?  You can answer these questions using recursion.</p>
        <p>When making monthly payments to repay a loan, an interest payment is charged on all of the money that is owed at the end of each month.  In this example, at the end of the first month you will owe <m>(0.0045)(10,000)=\$45.00</m> in interest. After making the first payment you will owe <m>\$10,000+\$45-\$230=\$9815</m>. The amount you still owe on the loan at the end of a month is equal to the amount you owed previously plus the interest minus the amount of your payment. This is expressed in a recursive system as: </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>L_0=10,000, L_{n-1}+(0.0045)\cdot L_{n-1}-230, where n=1,2,3,...</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>where <m>L_n</m> is the amount you owe on the loan after <m>n</m> months.  This amount is also known as the <em>principal</em>, or the <em>outstanding balance</em>. If we iterate this system, the values we generate represent the outstanding balance at the end of each month.</p>
        <md>
          <mrow>L_1=L_0+(0.0045)\cdot L_0-230=10,000+(0.0045)\cdot 10,000-230=9,815</mrow>
          <mrow>L_2=L_1+(0.0045)\cdot L_1-230=9,815+(0.0045)\cdot 9,815-230=9,629.17</mrow>
          <mrow>L_3=L_2+(0.0045)\cdot L_2-230=9,629.17+(0.0045)\cdot 9,629.17-230=9,442.50</mrow>

        <p>After three months, you will owe <m>\$9,442.50</m> on the loan. Notice that you have paid a total of <m>\$230\cdot 3=\$690</m>, but only <m>\$10,000-\$9442.50=\$557.50</m> was applied towards decreasing the principal of the loan. The remaining <m>\$132.50</m> was payment of interest.</p>

        </md>
        <p>After six months, you owe <m>\$8,877.44</m> of the original <m>\$10,000</m> principal.  You have paid <m>\$1,380</m> in interest, and this payment has reduced the outstanding balance by <m>\$1,122.56</m>.  Over <m>\$250</m> was interest on the loan.</p>
        <p>If we continue the payments of <m>\$230</m> for four years (48 months), the final payment will probably not bring the outstanding balance to exactly zero dollars.  Although it is possible to calculate a loan payment that will exactly pay off the loan in 48 equal payments, it is common practice for the lender to make all of the payments, except for the last one, a whole dollar amount, or even round these payments to the nearest five or ten-dollar amounts. Doing this will almost certainly make the final payment different from the rest.  This final payment is known as the balloon payment</p>
        <p>The graph and partial table in Figure XX show that it will take <m>47</m> payments to get the balance down to <m>\$341.20</m>.  After one additional month the balance will be <m>\$341.20\cdot 1.0045=\$342.74</m> if we round in the usual manner.  Thus, the balloon payment would be <m>\$342.74</m>.</p>

       <p>Since the first <m>47</m> payments were each <m>\$230</m>, the total amount paid is <m>47\cdot \$230 + \$342.74 = \$11,152.74</m>.  We see that it costs <m>\$1,152.74</m> to borrow <m>\$10,000</m> for <m>48</m> months.</p>
       <p>The process of paying off a loan is known as <em>amortizing the loan</em>, or <em>loan amortization</em>. When we study loan amortization, we are interested in the amount borrowed, the interest rate, the payment, the length of time it will take to repay the loan and the total amount the borrower will have to repay.</p>
       <p>We can generalize the recursive system used to determine the total amount repaid as follows.  If we borrow an amount <m>A</m> and let <m>r</m> represent the interest rate per time period and <m>P</m> the amount of the payment during each time period, we can describe the amount owed after <m>n</m> time periods with the system</p>

       <p>You should complete practice problem 1 at the end of the section at this time</p>
       <p>When borrowers take out a loan, they typically know the amount they want to borrow, the interest rate they will have to pay, and the length of time they have to pay off the loan.  We are interested in determining the payment that will allow the borrower to pay back the loan in the required time.  For most loans, the borrower makes payments every month. Thus, a car loan that needs to be repaid in <m>5</m> years requires <m>60</m> monthly payments and a mortgage loan that is repaid in <m>15</m> years requires <m>180</m> monthly payments. For simplicity's sake, our first few examples will assume that payments are made annually (that is, once per year) rather than monthly.</p>

       <example>
         <title>Finding the Yearly Payment Needed to Pay Off a Loan</title>
         <p>Suppose you buy a car and take out a loan of <m>\$22,000</m> at <m>6.5\%</m> annual interest to be paid back over four years.  What is the yearly payment you must make to pay off the loan in four equal payments?</p>
         <solution>
           <p>Referring to equation XX we have</p>

           </md>
           <p>and our goal is to find the value of <m>P</m> so that <m>L_4=0</m></p>
           <p>If there were no interest charged, you would have to make a payment of <m>\$5,500</m> each year to repay the <m>\$22,000</m>.  Since you must pay interest on the loan, <m>\$5,500</m> per year is obviously too small a payment and we conclude that <m> \> \$5,500</m>.  We can confirm that <m>\$5,500</m> is too small a payment  with the recursive system:</p>

         <p>This confirms that if we make an annual payment of <m>\$5,500</m> for each of 4 years, the outstanding balance on a loan of <m>\$22,000</m> is <m>\$4,062.80</m> at the end of the <m>4</m> years. So <m>\$5,500</m> is too small an annual payment to pay off the loan.</p>

         <p>With a <m>6.5\%</m> annual interest rate, we know that the interest for the first year is <m>\$1,430</m> ( <m>6.5\%</m> of <m>\$22,000</m> ), so a reasonable guess for the payment might be <m>\$5500+\$1430=\$6930</m>. However, in the second year we will need to pay less than <m>\$1430</m> in interest because the outstanding balance has decreased.  Therefore, a payment of <m>\$6930</m> per year will result in an overpayment for the last three years.  The calculations below show that <m>\$6930</m> is indeed too large an annual payment; that is, <m>P \lt 6,930</m>.</p>

          <p>We can continue the process of averaging two payments, one that is too large and one that is too small. Eventually we find that three payments of <m>\$6,393.75</m> and a fourth balloon payment of <m>\$6,393.75 + \$123.89</m> will bring the outstanding balance to zero dollars.</p>

         </solution>
       </example>
       <p>The process used to find an appropriate payment is called <em>binary search</em>. We began the process by finding an interval that contained the appropriate payment. This interval is bounded by a payment that is too low and a payment that is too high. We found the midpoint of the interval and determined if that payment was too large or too small.  If the "midpoint payment" is too high, that is, if we have a negative balance after four payments, then consider a new interval that is the lower half of the previous interval; otherwise, take the new interval to be the upper half of the previous interval We continue bisecting, which results in a smaller and smaller interval that we know contains the appropriate payment.  We stop bisecting the interval as soon as we have found a payment that results in a balance of zero, or as close to zero as we need.</p>

     <title>Geometric Growth and Decay</title>
      <p>Some recursively defined functions have important applications in life.  One of the simplest, yet most important, represents <em>geometric decay</em>. In geometric decay, the value of the function at time <m>n</m> is directly proportional to the value at time. This relationship suggests a recursive definition for geometric decay. The first example from Section <xref ref="chapter04-section01" />, Example <xref ref="ibuprofen-example-one-dose" />, involved the amount of ibuprofen in Joan's system at time <m>n</m> if she takes a single <m>200</m> mg tablet. Since her body filters out <m>67\%</m> of the ibuprofen present, the amount remaining after <m>n</m> time intervals is always <m>33\%</m> of the amount remaining after <m>n-1</m> time intervals.</p>
      <p>In that case, we calculated the amount of drug in Joan's boady with the recursive system</p>
      <md>

        <title>Fading Blue Jeans</title>
        <p>Blue jeans fade when they are washed. Suppose a pair of jeans loses <m>2\%</m> of its color with each washing.  How much of the original color is left after <m>50</m> washes?</p>
        <solution>
          <p>In this problem, we use the system</p>
          <md>
            <mrow>C_0=1, C_n=0.98 \cdot C_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>where <m>C_n</m> is the amount of color remaining in the jeans after <m>n</m> washings</p>
          <p>We use <m>1</m> as the initial value to represent all or <m>100\%</m> of the color.  Since we want to measure the amount of color remaining, the coefficient in the recursive equation is <m>0.98</m>.  With <m>50</m> iterations of the equation for <m>C_n</m>, we find that the jeans have about <m>36\%</m> of their original color left after <m>50</m> washings.</p>

        <p>The amount of electrical power used by a community is increasing by 5% per year.  This year, they used 500 thousand kilowatt-hours of electrical power.  How many years will it take until the electrical power consumption for this community has doubled?</p>
        <solution>
          <p>This is an example of <em>geometric growth</em>, since the amount of power is increasing each year. We use the recursive system</p>

          <p>Since the amount of power used is increasing by <m>5\%</m> each year, next year the citizens of the community will use <m>105\%</m> of what they used this year.  By iterating the equation for <m>P_n</m>, we find that after <m>14</m> years the community will use about <m>990</m> thousand kwh per year and after <m>15</m> years they will use about <m>1039</m> thousand kwh per year.  The amount of power required by the community will have doubled in a little less than <m>15</m> years.

        <title>Radioactive Decay</title>
        <p>Potassium-42 is a radioactive element that is often used in biological experiments as a tracer element.  Potassium-42, like all radioactive elements, decays into a non-radioactive form at a rate proportional to the amount present.  Potassium-42 loses <m>5.545\%</m> of its mass every hour.  If <m>1</m> milligram of potassium-42 is initially present in an animal, at what time will only <m>0.1</m> milligram be present?</p>
        <solution>
          <p>Note that the effect of losing <m>5.545\%</m> is equivalent to retaining <m>94.455\%</m>. We use the recursive system</p>

          </md>
          <p>We are interested in finding the amount of time until <m>P_n</m> is less than or equal to <m>0.1</m>.  Iterating the equation for <m>P_n</m>, we find that <m>P_{40} = 0.1021</m> and <m>P_{41} = 0.0964</m>. So after <m>40</m> hours, <m>0.1021</m> mg of potassium-42 remain, and after <m>41</m> hours, <m>0.0964</m> mg remain. Sometime between <m>40</m> and <m>41</m> hours we expect to have only <m>0.1</m> mg of potassium-42 remaining.</p>

          <p>The recursive system we used to generate amounts of potasium-42 does not allow us to determine the amount present between the <m>40^{th}</m> hour and the <m>41^{st}</m> hour.  The amount of potassium-42 changes incrementally between the <m>40^{th}</m> and the <m>41^{st}</m> hours, but the recursive equation we have used to represent this phenomenon cannot give us information about potassium levels between <m>P_{40}</m> and <m>P_{41}</m>.</p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>Each of the three previous examples uses a recursive system that can be written as </p>

        <mrow>Y_0=a,Y_n=(1+k) \cdot Y_{n-1}, n=1,2,3, ...</mrow>
      </md>
      <p> If <m>k \gt 0</m>, this system represents geometric growth (with growth rate <m>k</m>); as <m>n</m> increases, the value of <m>Y_n</m>  increases.  If <m>k \lt 0</m>, the system represents geometric decay (and <m>k</m> is the decay rate); as <m>n</m> increases, the value of <m>Y_n</m>  decreases.  In either case, the next value of <m>Y_n</m> depends entirely on the value of <m>k</m> and the old value of <m>Y_n</m>.</p>
      <p>Geometric growth that can be described with a recursive system can also be described by an explicit function.  To demonstrate, we will iterate the system used in Example <xref ref="example-radioactive-decay" /> to describe electricity consumption</p>

      <p>and the explicit equation</p>
      <md>

      <p>The recursive equation shows that each value of <m>Y_n</m>  is obtained from the preceding value by multiplying by <m>(1+k)</m>. The explicit equation uses an exponent to represent this repeated multiplication.</p>
      <p>If we wanted the value of <m>Y_{100}</m>, the recursive equation would require that values of <m>Y_1, Y_2, Y_3,</m> and so forth up to <m>Y_{99}</m>,  all be calculated. In contract, the explicit equaiotn <m>Y_n=a(1+k)^n</m> allows us to calculate <m>Y_{100}</m> without requiring any intermediate values.</p>
      <p>The explicit equation can be rewritten using the more traditional functional notation:</p>

      <p>In equation <xref ref="explicit-geometric-growth-equation" /> the independent variable <m>n</m> is in the exponent, so this function is an exponential function.

          <p>We can solve this problem using the recursive model <m>S_0 = a</m>, <m>S_n = (1.0045) S_{n-1}</m> but we will have to guess and check to find the appropriate value of <m>S_0</m> that gives of <m>S_{216} = 75,000</m>.  Using the closed form <m>S(n)=a(1.0045)^n</m> , we need to find the value of <m>a</m> such that <m>75,000 = a (1.0045)^{216}</m>.

The recursive representation is not able to tell us anything about the amount of potassium present between <m>P_2</m> and <m>P_3</m>, in fact, <m>P_{2.7}</m> is not even defined.</p>
          <p>The explicit function <m>P(t)=1 \cdot (0.944355)^t</m> uses <m>t</m> as a variable whose domain is all positive real numbers and <m>P(2.7)</m> is well-defined and meaningful. The explicit function can tell us the amount of Potassium-42 present at any time on the continuum between zero and infinity.</p>
          <p>Graphs of both the recursive and the explicit representations are shown below</p>

      </example>

      <p>Example <xref ref="example-continuous-discrete" /> shows that we must pay attention to issues of domain when we are choosing between using recursive and explicit representations of a particular phenomenon. Some phenomena by their very nature have a discrete (and thus discontinuous) domain, and these are often best represented recursively. Other phenomena are by nature continuous and may be better represented by an explicit function. Of course, with appropriate care about interpretations, we can choose to use a continuous function to represent a discrete phenomenon.  We can also use a discrete representation for a continuous phenomenon. If we choose to do this, we need to pay particular attention to the way that we interpret our calculations.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>Rebecca starts working for a company at a salary of <m>\$40,000</m> per year. Based on the company's history, she can expect raises of <m>3.5\%</m> each year on the anniversary of her employment. When will she first make <m>\$50,000</m>?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>We can use the recursive system <m>A_0=40,000, A_n=1.035A_{n-1}, n=1,2,3,...</m> to determine when her salary will equal or exceed <m>\$50,000</m>.  Rebecca’s first pay raise will result in a salary of <m>\$41,400</m>.  Her sixth raise will bring her salary up to <m>\$49,170.21</m> and her seventh raise will put her pay over <m>\$50,000</m> at <m>\$50,891.17</m>.</p>

          <p>We could also use a closed form function to solve for the time at which her salary will reach <m>\$50,000</m>.  This function is <m>S(t)=40,000(1.035)^t</m>. By evaluating this function, we find that <m>S(6)=49,170.21</m> and <m>S(7)=50,891.17</m>. Both the recursive model and the closed form model inform us that Rebecca will make more than <m>\$50,000</m> with her <m>7^{th}</m> raise.</p>

          <p>If we wanted to know what Rebecca would make if she stayed with this company for <m>30</m> years, it would be easier to use the closed form and substitute <m>t=30</m>.  In many cases either the recursive system or the closed form could be used to arrive at the same answer. In cases where we need to predict far into the future, it is more efficient to use the closed form. In cases where we want to see all of the intermediate values, as would be the case for the balance due on a loan after each payment, it would be to our advantage to use the recursive system. In Rebecca's case, if we choose to use an explicit representation we must limit the domain to integer values since her pay raises occur only one time per year.</p>

      <p>A doubling of function-values takes place with each increase of <m>1</m> unit in <m>t</m></p>
      <p>The function <m>g(t)=2^{\frac{1}{3} t}</m> is a horizontal stretch of the function <m>f(t)=2^t</m>, and this transformation makes <m>g(t)</m> have a doubling time of <m>3</m> time units:</p>
      <md>
        <mrow>g(3)=2^{\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3}=2^1=2</mrow>

      <p>Since <m>g(t)=2^{\frac{1}{3} t}</m> has a doubling time of <m>3</m> time units, in Example <xref ref="example-doubling-time" /> we could have used the function <m>y = 150 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} t}</m> to model the number of bacteria cells present at time <m>t</m>. You can confirm that the two functions <m>y = 150 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} t}</m> and <m>P(t)=150 \cdot (1.26)^t</m> produce roughly the same ordered pairs.</p>
